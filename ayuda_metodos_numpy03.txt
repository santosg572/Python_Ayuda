logical_and = <ufunc 'logical_and'>
    logical_and(x1, x2, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj])

    Compute the truth value of x1 AND x2 element-wise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x1, x2 : array_like
        Input arrays.
        If ``x1.shape != x2.shape``, they must be broadcastable to a common
        shape (which becomes the shape of the output).
    out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
        a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
        a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
        keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
    where : array_like, optional
        This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
        condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
        Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
        Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
        ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
        remain uninitialized.
    **kwargs
        For other keyword-only arguments, see the
        :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray or bool
        Boolean result of the logical AND operation applied to the elements
        of `x1` and `x2`; the shape is determined by broadcasting.
        This is a scalar if both `x1` and `x2` are scalars.

    See Also
    --------
    logical_or, logical_not, logical_xor
    bitwise_and

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.logical_and(True, False)
    False
    >>> np.logical_and([True, False], [False, False])
    array([False, False])

    >>> x = np.arange(5)
    >>> np.logical_and(x>1, x<4)
    array([False, False,  True,  True, False])


    The ``&`` operator can be used as a shorthand for ``np.logical_and`` on
    boolean ndarrays.

    >>> a = np.array([True, False])
    >>> b = np.array([False, False])
    >>> a & b
    array([False, False])

logspace(start, stop, num=50, endpoint=True, base=10.0, dtype=None, axis=0)
    Return numbers spaced evenly on a log scale.

    In linear space, the sequence starts at ``base ** start``
    (`base` to the power of `start`) and ends with ``base ** stop``
    (see `endpoint` below).

    .. versionchanged:: 1.16.0
        Non-scalar `start` and `stop` are now supported.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.25.0
        Non-scalar 'base` is now supported

    Parameters
    ----------
    start : array_like
        ``base ** start`` is the starting value of the sequence.
    stop : array_like
        ``base ** stop`` is the final value of the sequence, unless `endpoint`
        is False.  In that case, ``num + 1`` values are spaced over the
        interval in log-space, of which all but the last (a sequence of
        length `num`) are returned.
    num : integer, optional
        Number of samples to generate.  Default is 50.
    endpoint : boolean, optional
        If true, `stop` is the last sample. Otherwise, it is not included.
        Default is True.
    base : array_like, optional
        The base of the log space. The step size between the elements in
        ``ln(samples) / ln(base)`` (or ``log_base(samples)``) is uniform.
        Default is 10.0.
    dtype : dtype
        The type of the output array.  If `dtype` is not given, the data type
        is inferred from `start` and `stop`. The inferred type will never be
        an integer; `float` is chosen even if the arguments would produce an
        array of integers.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis in the result to store the samples.  Relevant only if start,
        stop, or base are array-like.  By default (0), the samples will be
        along a new axis inserted at the beginning. Use -1 to get an axis at
        the end.

        .. versionadded:: 1.16.0


    Returns
    -------
    samples : ndarray
        `num` samples, equally spaced on a log scale.

    See Also
    --------
    arange : Similar to linspace, with the step size specified instead of the
             number of samples. Note that, when used with a float endpoint, the
             endpoint may or may not be included.
    linspace : Similar to logspace, but with the samples uniformly distributed
               in linear space, instead of log space.
    geomspace : Similar to logspace, but with endpoints specified directly.
    :ref:`how-to-partition`

    Notes
    -----
    If base is a scalar, logspace is equivalent to the code

Help on function lookfor in module numpy:

lookfor(what, module=None, import_modules=True, regenerate=False, output=None)
    Do a keyword search on docstrings.

    A list of objects that matched the search is displayed,
    sorted by relevance. All given keywords need to be found in the
    docstring for it to be returned as a result, but the order does
    not matter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    what : str
        String containing words to look for.
    module : str or list, optional
        Name of module(s) whose docstrings to go through.
    import_modules : bool, optional
        Whether to import sub-modules in packages. Default is True.
    regenerate : bool, optional
        Whether to re-generate the docstring cache. Default is False.
    output : file-like, optional
        File-like object to write the output to. If omitted, use a pager.

    See Also
    --------

    Notes
    -----
    Relevance is determined only roughly, by checking if the keywords occur
    in the function name, at the start of a docstring, etc.

Help on function asmatrix in module numpy:

asmatrix(data, dtype=None)
    Interpret the input as a matrix.

    Unlike `matrix`, `asmatrix` does not make a copy if the input is already
    a matrix or an ndarray.  Equivalent to ``matrix(data, copy=False)``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array_like
        Input data.
    dtype : data-type
       Data-type of the output matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    mat : matrix
        `data` interpreted as a matrix.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

    >>> m = np.asmatrix(x)

    >>> x[0,0] = 5

mean(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None, keepdims=<no value>, *, where=<no value>)
    Compute the arithmetic mean along the specified axis.

    Returns the average of the array elements.  The average is taken over
    the flattened array by default, otherwise over the specified axis.
    `float64` intermediate and return values are used for integer inputs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose mean is desired. If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which the means are computed. The default is to
        compute the mean of the flattened array.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        If this is a tuple of ints, a mean is performed over multiple axes,
        instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Type to use in computing the mean.  For integer inputs, the default
        is `float64`; for floating point inputs, it is the same as the
        input dtype.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  The default
        is ``None``; if provided, it must have the same shape as the
        expected output, but the type will be cast if necessary.
        See :ref:`ufuncs-output-type` for more details.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the input array.

        If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be
        passed through to the `mean` method of sub-classes of
        `ndarray`, however any non-default value will be.  If the
        sub-class' method does not implement `keepdims` any
        exceptions will be raised.

    where : array_like of bool, optional
        Elements to include in the mean. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.20.0

    Returns
    -------
    m : ndarray, see dtype parameter above
        If `out=None`, returns a new array containing the mean values,
        otherwise a reference to the output array is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    average : Weighted average
    std, var, nanmean, nanstd, nanvar

    Notes
    -----
    The arithmetic mean is the sum of the elements along the axis divided
    by the number of elements.

    Note that for floating-point input, the mean is computed using the
    same precision the input has.  Depending on the input data, this can
    cause the results to be inaccurate, especially for `float32` (see
    example below).  Specifying a higher-precision accumulator using the
    `dtype` keyword can alleviate this issue.

    By default, `float16` results are computed using `float32` intermediates
    for extra precision.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> np.mean(a)
    2.5
    >>> np.mean(a, axis=0)
    array([2., 3.])
    >>> np.mean(a, axis=1)
    array([1.5, 3.5])

    In single precision, `mean` can be inaccurate:

    >>> a = np.zeros((2, 512*512), dtype=np.float32)
    >>> a[0, :] = 1.0
    >>> a[1, :] = 0.1
    >>> np.mean(a)
    0.54999924

    Computing the mean in float64 is more accurate:

    >>> np.mean(a, dtype=np.float64)
    0.55000000074505806 # may vary

    Specifying a where argument:

    >>> a = np.array([[5, 9, 13], [14, 10, 12], [11, 15, 19]])
    >>> np.mean(a)
    12.0
    >>> np.mean(a, where=[[True], [False], [False]])

meshgrid(*xi, copy=True, sparse=False, indexing='xy')
    Return a list of coordinate matrices from coordinate vectors.

    Make N-D coordinate arrays for vectorized evaluations of
    N-D scalar/vector fields over N-D grids, given
    one-dimensional coordinate arrays x1, x2,..., xn.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.9
       1-D and 0-D cases are allowed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x1, x2,..., xn : array_like
        1-D arrays representing the coordinates of a grid.
    indexing : {'xy', 'ij'}, optional
        Cartesian ('xy', default) or matrix ('ij') indexing of output.
        See Notes for more details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0
    sparse : bool, optional
        If True the shape of the returned coordinate array for dimension *i*
        is reduced from ``(N1, ..., Ni, ... Nn)`` to
        ``(1, ..., 1, Ni, 1, ..., 1)``.  These sparse coordinate grids are
        intended to be use with :ref:`basics.broadcasting`.  When all
        coordinates are used in an expression, broadcasting still leads to a
        fully-dimensonal result array.

        Default is False.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0
    copy : bool, optional
        If False, a view into the original arrays are returned in order to
        conserve memory.  Default is True.  Please note that
        ``sparse=False, copy=False`` will likely return non-contiguous
        arrays.  Furthermore, more than one element of a broadcast array
        may refer to a single memory location.  If you need to write to the
        arrays, make copies first.

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

    Returns
    -------
    X1, X2,..., XN : list of ndarrays
        For vectors `x1`, `x2`,..., `xn` with lengths ``Ni=len(xi)``,
        returns ``(N1, N2, N3,..., Nn)`` shaped arrays if indexing='ij'
        or ``(N2, N1, N3,..., Nn)`` shaped arrays if indexing='xy'
        with the elements of `xi` repeated to fill the matrix along
        the first dimension for `x1`, the second for `x2` and so on.

    Notes
    -----
    This function supports both indexing conventions through the indexing
    keyword argument.  Giving the string 'ij' returns a meshgrid with
    matrix indexing, while 'xy' returns a meshgrid with Cartesian indexing.
    In the 2-D case with inputs of length M and N, the outputs are of shape
    (N, M) for 'xy' indexing and (M, N) for 'ij' indexing.  In the 3-D case
    with inputs of length M, N and P, outputs are of shape (N, M, P) for
    'xy' indexing and (M, N, P) for 'ij' indexing.  The difference is
    illustrated by the following code snippet::

        xv, yv = np.meshgrid(x, y, indexing='ij')
        for i in range(nx):
            for j in range(ny):
                # treat xv[i,j], yv[i,j]

        xv, yv = np.meshgrid(x, y, indexing='xy')
        for i in range(nx):
            for j in range(ny):
                # treat xv[j,i], yv[j,i]

    In the 1-D and 0-D case, the indexing and sparse keywords have no effect.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> nx, ny = (3, 2)
    >>> x = np.linspace(0, 1, nx)
    >>> y = np.linspace(0, 1, ny)

    >>> yv
    array([[0.,  0.,  0.],
           [1.,  1.,  1.]])

    The result of `meshgrid` is a coordinate grid:

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> plt.plot(xv, yv, marker='o', color='k', linestyle='none')
    >>> plt.show()

    You can create sparse output arrays to save memory and computation time.

    >>> xv, yv = np.meshgrid(x, y, sparse=True)
    >>> xv
    array([[0. ,  0.5,  1. ]])
    >>> yv
    array([[0.],
           [1.]])

    `meshgrid` is very useful to evaluate functions on a grid. If the
    function depends on all coordinates, both dense and sparse outputs can be
    used.

    >>> x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 101)
    >>> y = np.linspace(-5, 5, 101)

remainder = <ufunc 'remainder'>
    remainder(x1, x2, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K', dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj])

    Returns the element-wise remainder of division.

    Computes the remainder complementary to the `floor_divide` function.  It is
    equivalent to the Python modulus operator``x1 % x2`` and has the same sign
    as the divisor `x2`. The MATLAB function equivalent to ``np.remainder``
    is ``mod``.

    .. warning::

        This should not be confused with:

        * Python 3.7's `math.remainder` and C's ``remainder``, which
          computes the IEEE remainder, which are the complement to
          ``round(x1 / x2)``.
        * The MATLAB ``rem`` function and or the C ``%`` operator which is the
          complement to ``int(x1 / x2)``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x1 : array_like
        Dividend array.
    x2 : array_like
        Divisor array.
        If ``x1.shape != x2.shape``, they must be broadcastable to a common
        shape (which becomes the shape of the output).
    out : ndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional
        A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have
        a shape that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None,
        a freshly-allocated array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a
        keyword argument) must have length equal to the number of outputs.
    where : array_like, optional
        This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the
        condition is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result.
        Elsewhere, the `out` array will retain its original value.
        Note that if an uninitialized `out` array is created via the default
        ``out=None``, locations within it where the condition is False will
        remain uninitialized.
    **kwargs
        For other keyword-only arguments, see the
        :ref:`ufunc docs <ufuncs.kwargs>`.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        The element-wise remainder of the quotient ``floor_divide(x1, x2)``.
        This is a scalar if both `x1` and `x2` are scalars.

    divmod : Simultaneous floor division and remainder.
    fmod : Equivalent of the MATLAB ``rem`` function.

    Notes
    -----
    Returns 0 when `x2` is 0 and both `x1` and `x2` are (arrays of)
    integers.
    ``mod`` is an alias of ``remainder``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.remainder([4, 7], [2, 3])

    >>> np.remainder(np.arange(7), 5)

Help on _ArrayFunctionDispatcher in module numpy:

nanmin(a, axis=None, out=None, keepdims=<no value>, initial=<no value>, where=<no value>)
    Return minimum of an array or minimum along an axis, ignoring any NaNs.
    When all-NaN slices are encountered a ``RuntimeWarning`` is raised and
    Nan is returned for that slice.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose minimum is desired. If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the minimum is computed. The default is to compute
        the minimum of the flattened array.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  The default
        is ``None``; if provided, it must have the same shape as the
        expected output, but the type will be cast if necessary. See
        :ref:`ufuncs-output-type` for more details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.8.0
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.

        If the value is anything but the default, then
        `keepdims` will be passed through to the `min` method
        of sub-classes of `ndarray`.  If the sub-classes methods
        does not implement `keepdims` any exceptions will be raised.

        .. versionadded:: 1.8.0
    initial : scalar, optional
        The maximum value of an output element. Must be present to allow
        computation on empty slice. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.22.0
    where : array_like of bool, optional
        Elements to compare for the minimum. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce`
        for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.22.0

    Returns
    -------
    nanmin : ndarray
        An array with the same shape as `a`, with the specified axis
        removed.  If `a` is a 0-d array, or if axis is None, an ndarray
        scalar is returned.  The same dtype as `a` is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    nanmax :
        The maximum value of an array along a given axis, ignoring any NaNs.
    amin :
        The minimum value of an array along a given axis, propagating any NaNs.
    fmin :
        Element-wise minimum of two arrays, ignoring any NaNs.
    minimum :
        Element-wise minimum of two arrays, propagating any NaNs.
    isnan :
        Shows which elements are Not a Number (NaN).
    isfinite:
        Shows which elements are neither NaN nor infinity.

    amax, fmax, maximum

    Notes
    -----
    NumPy uses the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point for Arithmetic
    (IEEE 754). This means that Not a Number is not equivalent to infinity.
    Positive infinity is treated as a very large number and negative
    infinity is treated as a very small (i.e. negative) number.

    If the input has a integer type the function is equivalent to np.min.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, np.nan]])
    >>> np.nanmin(a)
    1.0
    >>> np.nanmin(a, axis=0)
    array([1.,  2.])
    >>> np.nanmin(a, axis=1)
    array([1.,  3.])

    When positive infinity and negative infinity are present:

    >>> np.nanmin([1, 2, np.nan, np.inf])
    1.0
    >>> np.nanmin([1, 2, np.nan, np.NINF])
    -inf

Help on class ndarray in module numpy:

class ndarray(builtins.object)
 |  ndarray(shape, dtype=float, buffer=None, offset=0,
 |          strides=None, order=None)
 |
 |  An array object represents a multidimensional, homogeneous array
 |  of fixed-size items.  An associated data-type object describes the
 |  format of each element in the array (its byte-order, how many bytes it
 |  occupies in memory, whether it is an integer, a floating point number,
 |  or something else, etc.)
 |
 |  Arrays should be constructed using `array`, `zeros` or `empty` (refer
 |  to the See Also section below).  The parameters given here refer to
 |  a low-level method (`ndarray(...)`) for instantiating an array.
 |
 |  For more information, refer to the `numpy` module and examine the
 |  methods and attributes of an array.
 |
 |  Parameters
 |  ----------
 |  (for the __new__ method; see Notes below)
 |
 |  shape : tuple of ints
 |      Shape of created array.
 |  dtype : data-type, optional
 |      Any object that can be interpreted as a numpy data type.
 |  buffer : object exposing buffer interface, optional
 |      Used to fill the array with data.
 |  offset : int, optional
 |      Offset of array data in buffer.
 |  strides : tuple of ints, optional
 |      Strides of data in memory.
 |  order : {'C', 'F'}, optional
 |      Row-major (C-style) or column-major (Fortran-style) order.
 |
 |  Attributes
 |  ----------
 |  T : ndarray
 |      Transpose of the array.
 |  data : buffer
 |      The array's elements, in memory.
 |  dtype : dtype object
 |      Describes the format of the elements in the array.
 |  flags : dict
 |      Dictionary containing information related to memory use, e.g.,
 |      'C_CONTIGUOUS', 'OWNDATA', 'WRITEABLE', etc.
 |  flat : numpy.flatiter object
 |      Flattened version of the array as an iterator.  The iterator
 |      allows assignments, e.g., ``x.flat = 3`` (See `ndarray.flat` for
 |      assignment examples; TODO).
 |  imag : ndarray
 |      Imaginary part of the array.
 |  real : ndarray
 |      Real part of the array.
 |  size : int
 |      Number of elements in the array.
 |  itemsize : int
 |      The memory use of each array element in bytes.
 |  nbytes : int
 |      The total number of bytes required to store the array data,
 |      i.e., ``itemsize * size``.
 |  ndim : int
 |      The array's number of dimensions.
 |  shape : tuple of ints
 |      Shape of the array.
 |  strides : tuple of ints
 |      The step-size required to move from one element to the next in
 |      memory. For example, a contiguous ``(3, 4)`` array of type
 |      ``int16`` in C-order has strides ``(8, 2)``.  This implies that
 |      to move from element to element in memory requires jumps of 2 bytes.
 |      To move from row-to-row, one needs to jump 8 bytes at a time
 |      (``2 * 4``).
 |  ctypes : ctypes object
 |      Class containing properties of the array needed for interaction
 |      with ctypes.
 |  base : ndarray
 |      If the array is a view into another array, that array is its `base`
 |      (unless that array is also a view).  The `base` array is where the
 |      array data is actually stored.
 |
 |  See Also
 |  --------
 |  array : Construct an array.
 |  zeros : Create an array, each element of which is zero.
 |  empty : Create an array, but leave its allocated memory unchanged (i.e.,
 |          it contains "garbage").
 |  dtype : Create a data-type.
 |  numpy.typing.NDArray : An ndarray alias :term:`generic <generic type>`
 |                         w.r.t. its `dtype.type <numpy.dtype.type>`.
 |
 |  Notes
 |  -----
 |  There are two modes of creating an array using ``__new__``:
 |
 |  1. If `buffer` is None, then only `shape`, `dtype`, and `order`
 |     are used.
 |  2. If `buffer` is an object exposing the buffer interface, then
 |     all keywords are interpreted.
 |
 |  No ``__init__`` method is needed because the array is fully initialized
 |  after the ``__new__`` method.
 |
 |  Examples
 |  --------
 |  These examples illustrate the low-level `ndarray` constructor.  Refer
 |  to the `See Also` section above for easier ways of constructing an
 |  ndarray.
 |
 |  First mode, `buffer` is None:
 |
 |  >>> np.ndarray(shape=(2,2), dtype=float, order='F')
 |  array([[0.0e+000, 0.0e+000], # random
 |         [     nan, 2.5e-323]])
 |
 |  Second mode:
 |
 |  >>> np.ndarray((2,), buffer=np.array([1,2,3]),
 |  ...            offset=np.int_().itemsize,
 |  ...            dtype=int) # offset = 1*itemsize, i.e. skip first element

 |
 |  astype(...)
 |      a.astype(dtype, order='K', casting='unsafe', subok=True, copy=True)
 |
 |      Copy of the array, cast to a specified type.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      dtype : str or dtype
 |          Typecode or data-type to which the array is cast.
 |      order : {'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, optional
 |          Controls the memory layout order of the result.
 |          'C' means C order, 'F' means Fortran order, 'A'
 |          means 'F' order if all the arrays are Fortran contiguous,
 |          'C' order otherwise, and 'K' means as close to the
 |          order the array elements appear in memory as possible.
 |          Default is 'K'.
 |      casting : {'no', 'equiv', 'safe', 'same_kind', 'unsafe'}, optional
 |          Controls what kind of data casting may occur. Defaults to 'unsafe'
 |          for backwards compatibility.
 |
 |            * 'no' means the data types should not be cast at all.
 |            * 'equiv' means only byte-order changes are allowed.
 |            * 'safe' means only casts which can preserve values are allowed.
 |            * 'same_kind' means only safe casts or casts within a kind,
 |              like float64 to float32, are allowed.
 |            * 'unsafe' means any data conversions may be done.
 |      subok : bool, optional
 |          If True, then sub-classes will be passed-through (default), otherwise
 |          the returned array will be forced to be a base-class array.
 |      copy : bool, optional
 |          By default, astype always returns a newly allocated array. If this
 |          is set to false, and the `dtype`, `order`, and `subok`
 |          requirements are satisfied, the input array is returned instead
 |          of a copy.
 |
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      arr_t : ndarray
 |          Unless `copy` is False and the other conditions for returning the input
 |          array are satisfied (see description for `copy` input parameter), `arr_t`
 |          is a new array of the same shape as the input array, with dtype, order
 |          given by `dtype`, `order`.
 |
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      .. versionchanged:: 1.17.0
 |         Casting between a simple data type and a structured one is possible only
 |         for "unsafe" casting.  Casting to multiple fields is allowed, but
 |         casting from multiple fields is not.
 |
 |      .. versionchanged:: 1.9.0
 |         Casting from numeric to string types in 'safe' casting mode requires
 |         that the string dtype length is long enough to store the max
 |         integer/float value converted.
 |
 |      Raises
 |      ------
 |      ComplexWarning
 |          When casting from complex to float or int. To avoid this,
 |          one should use ``a.real.astype(t)``.
 |
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 2.5])
 |      >>> x
 |      array([1. ,  2. ,  2.5])
 |
 |      >>> x.astype(int)
 |      array([1, 2, 2])
 |
 |  byteswap(...)
 |      a.byteswap(inplace=False)
 |
 |      Swap the bytes of the array elements
 |
 |      Toggle between low-endian and big-endian data representation by
 |      returning a byteswapped array, optionally swapped in-place.
 |      Arrays of byte-strings are not swapped. The real and imaginary
 |      parts of a complex number are swapped individually.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      inplace : bool, optional
 |          If ``True``, swap bytes in-place, default is ``False``.
 |
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      out : ndarray
 |          The byteswapped array. If `inplace` is ``True``, this is
 |          a view to self.
 |
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      >>> A = np.array([1, 256, 8755], dtype=np.int16)
 |      >>> list(map(hex, A))
 |      ['0x1', '0x100', '0x2233']
 |      >>> A.byteswap(inplace=True)
 |      array([  256,     1, 13090], dtype=int16)
 |      >>> list(map(hex, A))
 |      ['0x100', '0x1', '0x3322']
 |
 |      Arrays of byte-strings are not swapped
 |
 |      >>> A = np.array([b'ceg', b'fac'])
 |      >>> A.byteswap()
 |      array([b'ceg', b'fac'], dtype='|S3')
 |
 |      ``A.newbyteorder().byteswap()`` produces an array with the same values
 |        but different representation in memory
 |
 |      >>> A = np.array([1, 2, 3])
 |      >>> A.view(np.uint8)
 |      array([1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
 |             0, 0], dtype=uint8)
 |      >>> A.newbyteorder().byteswap(inplace=True)
 |      array([1, 2, 3])
 |      >>> A.view(np.uint8)
 |      array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
 |             0, 3], dtype=uint8)

 |
 |  copy(...)
 |      a.copy(order='C')
 |
 |      Return a copy of the array.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      order : {'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, optional
 |          Controls the memory layout of the copy. 'C' means C-order,
 |          'F' means F-order, 'A' means 'F' if `a` is Fortran contiguous,
 |          'C' otherwise. 'K' means match the layout of `a` as closely
 |          as possible. (Note that this function and :func:`numpy.copy` are very
 |          similar but have different default values for their order=
 |          arguments, and this function always passes sub-classes through.)
 |
 |      See also
 |      --------
 |      numpy.copy : Similar function with different default behavior
 |      numpy.copyto
 |
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      This function is the preferred method for creating an array copy.  The
 |      function :func:`numpy.copy` is similar, but it defaults to using order 'K',
 |      and will not pass sub-classes through by default.
 |
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      >>> x = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]], order='F')
 |
 |      >>> y = x.copy()
 |
 |      >>> x.fill(0)
 |
 |      >>> x
 |      array([[0, 0, 0],
 |             [0, 0, 0]])
 |
 |      >>> y
 |      array([[1, 2, 3],
 |             [4, 5, 6]])
 |
 |      >>> y.flags['C_CONTIGUOUS']
 |      True
 |
 |  cumprod(...)
 |      a.cumprod(axis=None, dtype=None, out=None)
 |
 |      Return the cumulative product of the elements along the given axis.
 |
 |      Refer to `numpy.cumprod` for full documentation.
 |

 |      --------

 |
 |  cumsum(...)
 |      a.cumsum(axis=None, dtype=None, out=None)
 |
 |      Return the cumulative sum of the elements along the given axis.
 |
 |      Refer to `numpy.cumsum` for full documentation.

 |      --------
 |      numpy.cumsum : equivalent function
 |
 |  diagonal(...)
 |      a.diagonal(offset=0, axis1=0, axis2=1)
 |
 |      Return specified diagonals. In NumPy 1.9 the returned array is a
 |      read-only view instead of a copy as in previous NumPy versions.  In
 |      a future version the read-only restriction will be removed.
 |
 |      Refer to :func:`numpy.diagonal` for full documentation.
 |
 |      See Also
 |      --------
 |      numpy.diagonal : equivalent function
 |
 |  dot(...)
 |
 |  dump(...)
 |      a.dump(file)
 |
 |      Dump a pickle of the array to the specified file.
 |      The array can be read back with pickle.load or numpy.load.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      file : str or Path
 |          A string naming the dump file.
 |
 |          .. versionchanged:: 1.17.0
 |              `pathlib.Path` objects are now accepted.
 |
 |  dumps(...)
 |      a.dumps()
 |
 |      Returns the pickle of the array as a string.
 |      pickle.loads will convert the string back to an array.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      None
 |
 |  fill(...)
 |      a.fill(value)
 |
 |      Fill the array with a scalar value.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      value : scalar
 |          All elements of `a` will be assigned this value.
 |
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      >>> a = np.array([1, 2])
 |      >>> a.fill(0)
 |      >>> a
 |      array([0, 0])
 |      >>> a = np.empty(2)
 |      >>> a.fill(1)
 |      >>> a
 |      array([1.,  1.])
 |
 |      Fill expects a scalar value and always behaves the same as assigning
 |      to a single array element.  The following is a rare example where this
 |      distinction is important:
 |
 |      >>> a = np.array([None, None], dtype=object)
 |      >>> a[0] = np.array(3)
 |      >>> a
 |      array([array(3), None], dtype=object)
 |      >>> a.fill(np.array(3))
 |      >>> a
 |      array([array(3), array(3)], dtype=object)
 |
 |      Where other forms of assignments will unpack the array being assigned:
 |
 |      >>> a[...] = np.array(3)
 |      >>> a
 |      array([3, 3], dtype=object)
 |
 |  flatten(...)
 |      a.flatten(order='C')
 |
 |      Return a copy of the array collapsed into one dimension.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      order : {'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, optional
 |          'C' means to flatten in row-major (C-style) order.
 |          'F' means to flatten in column-major (Fortran-
 |          style) order. 'A' means to flatten in column-major
 |          order if `a` is Fortran *contiguous* in memory,
 |          row-major order otherwise. 'K' means to flatten
 |          `a` in the order the elements occur in memory.
 |          The default is 'C'.
 |
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      y : ndarray
 |          A copy of the input array, flattened to one dimension.
 |
 |      See Also
 |      --------
 |      ravel : Return a flattened array.
 |      flat : A 1-D flat iterator over the array.
 |
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      >>> a = np.array([[1,2], [3,4]])
 |      >>> a.flatten()
 |      array([1, 2, 3, 4])
 |      >>> a.flatten('F')
 |      array([1, 3, 2, 4])
 |
 |  getfield(...)
 |      a.getfield(dtype, offset=0)
 |
 |      Returns a field of the given array as a certain type.
 |
 |      A field is a view of the array data with a given data-type. The values in
 |      the view are determined by the given type and the offset into the current
 |      array in bytes. The offset needs to be such that the view dtype fits in the
 |      array dtype; for example an array of dtype complex128 has 16-byte elements.
 |      If taking a view with a 32-bit integer (4 bytes), the offset needs to be
 |      between 0 and 12 bytes.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      dtype : str or dtype
 |          The data type of the view. The dtype size of the view can not be larger
 |          than that of the array itself.
 |      offset : int
 |          Number of bytes to skip before beginning the element view.
 |
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      >>> x = np.diag([1.+1.j]*2)
 |      >>> x[1, 1] = 2 + 4.j
 |      >>> x
 |      array([[1.+1.j,  0.+0.j],
 |             [0.+0.j,  2.+4.j]])
 |      >>> x.getfield(np.float64)
 |      array([[1.,  0.],
 |             [0.,  2.]])
 |
 |      By choosing an offset of 8 bytes we can select the complex part of the
 |      array for our view:
 |
 |      >>> x.getfield(np.float64, offset=8)
 |      array([[1.,  0.],
 |             [0.,  4.]])
 |
 |  item(...)
 |      a.item(*args)
 |
 |      Copy an element of an array to a standard Python scalar and return it.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      \*args : Arguments (variable number and type)
 |
 |          * none: in this case, the method only works for arrays
 |            with one element (`a.size == 1`), which element is
 |            copied into a standard Python scalar object and returned.
 |
 |          * int_type: this argument is interpreted as a flat index into
 |            the array, specifying which element to copy and return.
 |
 |          * tuple of int_types: functions as does a single int_type argument,
 |            except that the argument is interpreted as an nd-index into the
 |            array.
 |
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      z : Standard Python scalar object
 |          A copy of the specified element of the array as a suitable
 |          Python scalar
 |
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      When the data type of `a` is longdouble or clongdouble, item() returns
 |      a scalar array object because there is no available Python scalar that
 |      would not lose information. Void arrays return a buffer object for item(),
 |      unless fields are defined, in which case a tuple is returned.
 |
 |      `item` is very similar to a[args], except, instead of an array scalar,
 |      a standard Python scalar is returned. This can be useful for speeding up
 |      access to elements of the array and doing arithmetic on elements of the
 |      array using Python's optimized math.
 |
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      >>> np.random.seed(123)
 |      >>> x = np.random.randint(9, size=(3, 3))
 |      >>> x
 |      array([[2, 2, 6],
 |             [1, 3, 6],
 |             [1, 0, 1]])
 |      >>> x.item(3)
 |      1
 |      >>> x.item(7)
 |      0
 |      >>> x.item((0, 1))
 |      2
 |      >>> x.item((2, 2))
 |      1
 |
 |  itemset(...)
 |      a.itemset(*args)
 |
 |      Insert scalar into an array (scalar is cast to array's dtype, if possible)
 |
 |      There must be at least 1 argument, and define the last argument
 |      as *item*.  Then, ``a.itemset(*args)`` is equivalent to but faster
 |      than ``a[args] = item``.  The item should be a scalar value and `args`
 |      must select a single item in the array `a`.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      \*args : Arguments
 |          If one argument: a scalar, only used in case `a` is of size 1.
 |          If two arguments: the last argument is the value to be set
 |          and must be a scalar, the first argument specifies a single array
 |          element location. It is either an int or a tuple.
 |
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      Compared to indexing syntax, `itemset` provides some speed increase
 |      for placing a scalar into a particular location in an `ndarray`,
 |      if you must do this.  However, generally this is discouraged:
 |      among other problems, it complicates the appearance of the code.
 |      Also, when using `itemset` (and `item`) inside a loop, be sure
 |      to assign the methods to a local variable to avoid the attribute
 |      look-up at each loop iteration.
 |
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      >>> np.random.seed(123)
 |      >>> x = np.random.randint(9, size=(3, 3))
 |      >>> x
 |      array([[2, 2, 6],
 |             [1, 3, 6],
 |             [1, 0, 1]])
 |      >>> x.itemset(4, 0)
 |      >>> x.itemset((2, 2), 9)
 |      >>> x
 |      array([[2, 2, 6],
 |             [1, 0, 6],
 |             [1, 0, 9]])

 |
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      new_order : string, optional
 |          Byte order to force; a value from the byte order specifications
 |          below. `new_order` codes can be any of:
 |
 |          * 'S' - swap dtype from current to opposite endian
 |          * {'<', 'little'} - little endian
 |          * {'>', 'big'} - big endian
 |          * {'=', 'native'} - native order, equivalent to `sys.byteorder`
 |          * {'|', 'I'} - ignore (no change to byte order)
 |
 |          The default value ('S') results in swapping the current
 |          byte order.
 |
 |
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      new_arr : array
 |          New array object with the dtype reflecting given change to the
 |          byte order.
 |
 |  nonzero(...)
 |      a.nonzero()
 |
 |      Return the indices of the elements that are non-zero.
 |
 |      Refer to `numpy.nonzero` for full documentation.

 |      --------
 |      numpy.nonzero : equivalent function
 |
 |  partition(...)
 |      a.partition(kth, axis=-1, kind='introselect', order=None)
 |
 |      Rearranges the elements in the array in such a way that the value of the
 |      element in kth position is in the position it would be in a sorted array.
 |      All elements smaller than the kth element are moved before this element and
 |      all equal or greater are moved behind it. The ordering of the elements in
 |      the two partitions is undefined.
 |
 |      .. versionadded:: 1.8.0
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      kth : int or sequence of ints
 |          Element index to partition by. The kth element value will be in its
 |          final sorted position and all smaller elements will be moved before it
 |          and all equal or greater elements behind it.
 |          The order of all elements in the partitions is undefined.
 |          If provided with a sequence of kth it will partition all elements
 |          indexed by kth of them into their sorted position at once.
 |
 |          .. deprecated:: 1.22.0
 |              Passing booleans as index is deprecated.
 |      axis : int, optional
 |          Axis along which to sort. Default is -1, which means sort along the
 |          last axis.
 |      kind : {'introselect'}, optional
 |          Selection algorithm. Default is 'introselect'.
 |      order : str or list of str, optional
 |          When `a` is an array with fields defined, this argument specifies
 |          which fields to compare first, second, etc. A single field can
 |          be specified as a string, and not all fields need to be specified,
 |          but unspecified fields will still be used, in the order in which
 |          they come up in the dtype, to break ties.

 |
 |      See Also
 |      --------
 |      numpy.reshape : equivalent function
 |
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      Unlike the free function `numpy.reshape`, this method on `ndarray` allows
 |      the elements of the shape parameter to be passed in as separate arguments.
 |      For example, ``a.reshape(10, 11)`` is equivalent to
 |      ``a.reshape((10, 11))``.
 |
 |  resize(...)
 |      a.resize(new_shape, refcheck=True)
 |
 |      Change shape and size of array in-place.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      new_shape : tuple of ints, or `n` ints
 |          Shape of resized array.
 |      refcheck : bool, optional
 |          If False, reference count will not be checked. Default is True.
 |
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      None
 |
 |      Raises
 |      ------
 |      ValueError
 |          If `a` does not own its own data or references or views to it exist,
 |          and the data memory must be changed.
 |          PyPy only: will always raise if the data memory must be changed, since
 |          there is no reliable way to determine if references or views to it
 |          exist.
 |
 |      SystemError
 |          If the `order` keyword argument is specified. This behaviour is a
 |          bug in NumPy.
 |
 |      See Also
 |      --------
 |      resize : Return a new array with the specified shape.
 |
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      This reallocates space for the data area if necessary.
 |
 |      Only contiguous arrays (data elements consecutive in memory) can be
 |      resized.
 |
 |      The purpose of the reference count check is to make sure you
 |      do not use this array as a buffer for another Python object and then
 |      reallocate the memory. However, reference counts can increase in
 |      other ways so if you are sure that you have not shared the memory
 |      for this array with another Python object, then you may safely set
 |      `refcheck` to False.
 |
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      Shrinking an array: array is flattened (in the order that the data are
 |      stored in memory), resized, and reshaped:
 |
 |      >>> a = np.array([[0, 1], [2, 3]], order='C')
 |      >>> a.resize((2, 1))
 |      >>> a
 |      array([[0],
 |             [1]])
 |
 |      >>> a = np.array([[0, 1], [2, 3]], order='F')
 |      >>> a.resize((2, 1))
 |      >>> a
 |      array([[0],
 |             [2]])
 |
 |      Enlarging an array: as above, but missing entries are filled with zeros:
 |
 |      >>> b = np.array([[0, 1], [2, 3]])
 |      >>> b.resize(2, 3) # new_shape parameter doesn't have to be a tuple
 |      >>> b
 |      array([[0, 1, 2],
 |             [3, 0, 0]])
 |
 |      Referencing an array prevents resizing...
 |
 |      >>> c = a
 |      >>> a.resize((1, 1))
 |      Traceback (most recent call last):
 |      ...
 |      ValueError: cannot resize an array that references or is referenced ...
 |
 |      Unless `refcheck` is False:
 |
 |      >>> a.resize((1, 1), refcheck=False)
 |      >>> a
 |      array([[0]])
 |      >>> c
 |      array([[0]])
 |
 |  round(...)
 |      a.round(decimals=0, out=None)

 |
 |  setfield(...)
 |      a.setfield(val, dtype, offset=0)
 |
 |      Put a value into a specified place in a field defined by a data-type.
 |
 |      Place `val` into `a`'s field defined by `dtype` and beginning `offset`
 |      bytes into the field.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      val : object
 |          Value to be placed in field.
 |      dtype : dtype object
 |          Data-type of the field in which to place `val`.
 |      offset : int, optional

 |
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      None
 |
 |      See Also

 |
 |      Examples

 |      >>> x.getfield(np.float64)
 |      array([[1.,  0.,  0.],
 |             [0.,  1.,  0.],
 |             [0.,  0.,  1.]])
 |      >>> x.setfield(3, np.int32)
 |      >>> x.getfield(np.int32)
 |      array([[3, 3, 3],
 |             [3, 3, 3],
 |             [3, 3, 3]], dtype=int32)
 |      >>> x
 |      array([[1.0e+000, 1.5e-323, 1.5e-323],
 |             [1.5e-323, 1.0e+000, 1.5e-323],
 |             [1.5e-323, 1.5e-323, 1.0e+000]])
 |      >>> x.setfield(np.eye(3), np.int32)
 |      >>> x
 |      array([[1.,  0.,  0.],
 |             [0.,  1.,  0.],
 |             [0.,  0.,  1.]])
 |
 |  setflags(...)
 |      a.setflags(write=None, align=None, uic=None)
 |
 |      Set array flags WRITEABLE, ALIGNED, WRITEBACKIFCOPY,
 |      respectively.
 |
 |      These Boolean-valued flags affect how numpy interprets the memory
 |      area used by `a` (see Notes below). The ALIGNED flag can only
 |      be set to True if the data is actually aligned according to the type.
 |      The WRITEBACKIFCOPY and flag can never be set
 |      to True. The flag WRITEABLE can only be set to True if the array owns its
 |      own memory, or the ultimate owner of the memory exposes a writeable buffer
 |      interface, or is a string. (The exception for string is made so that
 |      unpickling can be done without copying memory.)
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      write : bool, optional
 |          Describes whether or not `a` can be written to.
 |      align : bool, optional
 |          Describes whether or not `a` is aligned properly for its type.
 |      uic : bool, optional
 |          Describes whether or not `a` is a copy of another "base" array.
 |
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      Array flags provide information about how the memory area used
 |      for the array is to be interpreted. There are 7 Boolean flags
 |      in use, only four of which can be changed by the user:
 |      WRITEBACKIFCOPY, WRITEABLE, and ALIGNED.
 |
 |      WRITEABLE (W) the data area can be written to;
 |
 |      ALIGNED (A) the data and strides are aligned appropriately for the hardware
 |      (as determined by the compiler);
 |
 |      WRITEBACKIFCOPY (X) this array is a copy of some other array (referenced
 |      by .base). When the C-API function PyArray_ResolveWritebackIfCopy is
 |      called, the base array will be updated with the contents of this array.
 |
 |      All flags can be accessed using the single (upper case) letter as well
 |      as the full name.
 |
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      >>> y = np.array([[3, 1, 7],
 |      ...               [2, 0, 0],
 |      ...               [8, 5, 9]])
 |      >>> y
 |      array([[3, 1, 7],
 |             [2, 0, 0],

 |
 |  sort(...)
 |      a.sort(axis=-1, kind=None, order=None)
 |
 |      Sort an array in-place. Refer to `numpy.sort` for full documentation.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      axis : int, optional
 |          Axis along which to sort. Default is -1, which means sort along the
 |          last axis.
 |      kind : {'quicksort', 'mergesort', 'heapsort', 'stable'}, optional
 |          Sorting algorithm. The default is 'quicksort'. Note that both 'stable'
 |          and 'mergesort' use timsort under the covers and, in general, the
 |          actual implementation will vary with datatype. The 'mergesort' option
 |          is retained for backwards compatibility.
 |
 |          .. versionchanged:: 1.15.0
 |             The 'stable' option was added.
 |
 |      order : str or list of str, optional
 |          When `a` is an array with fields defined, this argument specifies
 |          which fields to compare first, second, etc.  A single field can
 |          be specified as a string, and not all fields need be specified,
 |          but unspecified fields will still be used, in the order in which
 |          they come up in the dtype, to break ties.

 |  tobytes(...)
 |      a.tobytes(order='C')
 |
 |      Construct Python bytes containing the raw data bytes in the array.
 |
 |      Constructs Python bytes showing a copy of the raw contents of
 |      data memory. The bytes object is produced in C-order by default.
 |      This behavior is controlled by the ``order`` parameter.
 |
 |      .. versionadded:: 1.9.0
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      order : {'C', 'F', 'A'}, optional
 |          Controls the memory layout of the bytes object. 'C' means C-order,
 |          'F' means F-order, 'A' (short for *Any*) means 'F' if `a` is

 |      --------
 |      >>> x = np.array([[0, 1], [2, 3]], dtype='<u2')
 |      >>> x.tobytes()
 |      b'\x00\x00\x01\x00\x02\x00\x03\x00'
 |      >>> x.tobytes('C') == x.tobytes()
 |      True

 |
 |  tofile(...)
 |      a.tofile(fid, sep="", format="%s")
 |
 |      Write array to a file as text or binary (default).
 |
 |      Data is always written in 'C' order, independent of the order of `a`.
 |      The data produced by this method can be recovered using the function
 |      fromfile().
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      fid : file or str or Path
 |          An open file object, or a string containing a filename.
 |
 |          .. versionchanged:: 1.17.0
 |              `pathlib.Path` objects are now accepted.
 |
 |      sep : str
 |          Separator between array items for text output.
 |          If "" (empty), a binary file is written, equivalent to
 |          ``file.write(a.tobytes())``.
 |      format : str
 |          Format string for text file output.
 |          Each entry in the array is formatted to text by first converting
 |          it to the closest Python type, and then using "format" % item.
 |
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      This is a convenience function for quick storage of array data.
 |      Information on endianness and precision is lost, so this method is not a
 |      good choice for files intended to archive data or transport data between
 |      machines with different endianness. Some of these problems can be overcome
 |      by outputting the data as text files, at the expense of speed and file
 |      size.
 |
 |      When fid is a file object, array contents are directly written to the
 |      file, bypassing the file object's ``write`` method. As a result, tofile
 |      cannot be used with files objects supporting compression (e.g., GzipFile)
 |      or file-like objects that do not support ``fileno()`` (e.g., BytesIO).
 |
 |  tolist(...)
 |      a.tolist()
 |
 |      Return the array as an ``a.ndim``-levels deep nested list of Python scalars.
 |
 |      Return a copy of the array data as a (nested) Python list.
 |      Data items are converted to the nearest compatible builtin Python type, via
 |      the `~numpy.ndarray.item` function.
 |
 |      If ``a.ndim`` is 0, then since the depth of the nested list is 0, it will
 |      not be a list at all, but a simple Python scalar.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      none
 |
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      y : object, or list of object, or list of list of object, or ...
 |          The possibly nested list of array elements.
 |
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      The array may be recreated via ``a = np.array(a.tolist())``, although this
 |      may sometimes lose precision.
 |
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      For a 1D array, ``a.tolist()`` is almost the same as ``list(a)``,
 |      except that ``tolist`` changes numpy scalars to Python scalars:
 |
 |      >>> a = np.uint32([1, 2])
 |      >>> a_list = list(a)
 |      >>> a_list
 |      [1, 2]
 |      >>> type(a_list[0])
 |      <class 'numpy.uint32'>
 |      >>> a_tolist = a.tolist()
 |      >>> a_tolist
 |      [1, 2]
 |      >>> type(a_tolist[0])
 |      <class 'int'>
 |
 |      Additionally, for a 2D array, ``tolist`` applies recursively:
 |
 |      >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
 |      >>> list(a)
 |      [array([1, 2]), array([3, 4])]
 |      >>> a.tolist()
 |      [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
 |
 |      The base case for this recursion is a 0D array:
 |
 |      >>> a = np.array(1)
 |      >>> list(a)
 |      Traceback (most recent call last):
 |        ...
 |      TypeError: iteration over a 0-d array
 |      >>> a.tolist()
 |      1
 |
 |  tostring(...)
 |      a.tostring(order='C')
 |
 |      A compatibility alias for `tobytes`, with exactly the same behavior.
 |
 |      Despite its name, it returns `bytes` not `str`\ s.
 |
 |      .. deprecated:: 1.19.0
 |
 |  trace(...)
 |      a.trace(offset=0, axis1=0, axis2=1, dtype=None, out=None)
 |
 |      Return the sum along diagonals of the array.
 |
 |      Refer to `numpy.trace` for full documentation.
 |
 |      See Also
 |      --------
 |      numpy.trace : equivalent function
 |
 |  transpose(...)
 |      a.transpose(*axes)
 |
 |      Returns a view of the array with axes transposed.
 |
 |      Refer to `numpy.transpose` for full documentation.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      axes : None, tuple of ints, or `n` ints
 |
 |       * None or no argument: reverses the order of the axes.
 |
 |       * tuple of ints: `i` in the `j`-th place in the tuple means that the
 |         array's `i`-th axis becomes the transposed array's `j`-th axis.
 |
 |       * `n` ints: same as an n-tuple of the same ints (this form is
 |         intended simply as a "convenience" alternative to the tuple form).
 |
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      p : ndarray
 |          View of the array with its axes suitably permuted.
 |
 |      See Also
 |      --------
 |      transpose : Equivalent function.
 |      ndarray.T : Array property returning the array transposed.
 |      ndarray.reshape : Give a new shape to an array without changing its data.
 |
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
 |      >>> a
 |      array([[1, 2],
 |             [3, 4]])
 |      >>> a.transpose()
 |      array([[1, 3],
 |             [2, 4]])
 |      >>> a.transpose((1, 0))
 |      array([[1, 3],
 |             [2, 4]])
 |      >>> a.transpose(1, 0)
 |      array([[1, 3],
 |             [2, 4]])
 |
 |      >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
 |      >>> a
 |      array([1, 2, 3, 4])
 |      >>> a.transpose()
 |      array([1, 2, 3, 4])
 |
 |  var(...)
 |      a.var(axis=None, dtype=None, out=None, ddof=0, keepdims=False, *, where=True)
 |
 |      Returns the variance of the array elements, along given axis.
 |
 |      Refer to `numpy.var` for full documentation.
 |
 |      See Also
 |      --------
 |      numpy.var : equivalent function
 |
 |  view(...)
 |      a.view([dtype][, type])
 |
 |      New view of array with the same data.
 |
 |      .. note::
 |          Passing None for ``dtype`` is different from omitting the parameter,
 |          since the former invokes ``dtype(None)`` which is an alias for
 |          ``dtype('float_')``.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      dtype : data-type or ndarray sub-class, optional
 |          Data-type descriptor of the returned view, e.g., float32 or int16.
 |          Omitting it results in the view having the same data-type as `a`.
 |          This argument can also be specified as an ndarray sub-class, which
 |          then specifies the type of the returned object (this is equivalent to
 |          setting the ``type`` parameter).
 |      type : Python type, optional
 |          Type of the returned view, e.g., ndarray or matrix.  Again, omission
 |          of the parameter results in type preservation.
 |
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      ``a.view()`` is used two different ways:
 |
 |      ``a.view(some_dtype)`` or ``a.view(dtype=some_dtype)`` constructs a view
 |      of the array's memory with a different data-type.  This can cause a
 |      reinterpretation of the bytes of memory.
 |
 |      ``a.view(ndarray_subclass)`` or ``a.view(type=ndarray_subclass)`` just
 |      returns an instance of `ndarray_subclass` that looks at the same array
 |      (same shape, dtype, etc.)  This does not cause a reinterpretation of the
 |      memory.
 |
 |      For ``a.view(some_dtype)``, if ``some_dtype`` has a different number of
 |      bytes per entry than the previous dtype (for example, converting a regular
 |      array to a structured array), then the last axis of ``a`` must be
 |      contiguous. This axis will be resized in the result.
 |
 |      .. versionchanged:: 1.23.0
 |         Only the last axis needs to be contiguous. Previously, the entire array
 |         had to be C-contiguous.
 |
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      >>> x = np.array([(1, 2)], dtype=[('a', np.int8), ('b', np.int8)])
 |
 |      Viewing array data using a different type and dtype:
 |
 |      >>> y = x.view(dtype=np.int16, type=np.matrix)
 |      >>> y
 |      matrix([[513]], dtype=int16)
 |      >>> print(type(y))
 |      <class 'numpy.matrix'>
 |
 |      Creating a view on a structured array so it can be used in calculations
 |
 |      >>> x = np.array([(1, 2),(3,4)], dtype=[('a', np.int8), ('b', np.int8)])
 |      >>> xv = x.view(dtype=np.int8).reshape(-1,2)
 |      >>> xv
 |      array([[1, 2],
 |             [3, 4]], dtype=int8)
 |      >>> xv.mean(0)
 |      array([2.,  3.])
 |
 |      Making changes to the view changes the underlying array
 |
 |      >>> xv[0,1] = 20
 |      >>> x
 |      array([(1, 20), (3,  4)], dtype=[('a', 'i1'), ('b', 'i1')])
 |
 |      Using a view to convert an array to a recarray:
 |
 |      >>> z = x.view(np.recarray)
 |      >>> z.a
 |      array([1, 3], dtype=int8)
 |
 |      Views share data:
 |
 |      >>> x[0] = (9, 10)
 |      >>> z[0]
 |      (9, 10)
 |
 |      Views that change the dtype size (bytes per entry) should normally be
 |      avoided on arrays defined by slices, transposes, fortran-ordering, etc.:
 |
 |      >>> x = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], dtype=np.int16)
 |      >>> y = x[:, ::2]
 |      >>> y
 |      array([[1, 3],
 |             [4, 6]], dtype=int16)
 |      >>> y.view(dtype=[('width', np.int16), ('length', np.int16)])
 |      Traceback (most recent call last):
 |          ...
 |      ValueError: To change to a dtype of a different size, the last axis must be contiguous
 |      >>> z = y.copy()
 |      >>> z.view(dtype=[('width', np.int16), ('length', np.int16)])
 |      array([[(1, 3)],
 |             [(4, 6)]], dtype=[('width', '<i2'), ('length', '<i2')])
 |
 |      However, views that change dtype are totally fine for arrays with a
 |      contiguous last axis, even if the rest of the axes are not C-contiguous:
 |
 |      >>> x = np.arange(2 * 3 * 4, dtype=np.int8).reshape(2, 3, 4)
 |      >>> x.transpose(1, 0, 2).view(np.int16)
 |      array([[[ 256,  770],
 |              [3340, 3854]],
 |      <BLANKLINE>
 |             [[1284, 1798],
 |              [4368, 4882]],
 |      <BLANKLINE>
 |             [[2312, 2826],

 |
 |  ctypes
 |      An object to simplify the interaction of the array with the ctypes
 |      module.
 |
 |      This attribute creates an object that makes it easier to use arrays
 |      when calling shared libraries with the ctypes module. The returned
 |      object has, among others, data, shape, and strides attributes (see
 |      Notes below) which themselves return ctypes objects that can be used
 |      as arguments to a shared library.
 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      None
 |
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      c : Python object
 |          Possessing attributes data, shape, strides, etc.
 |
 |      See Also
 |      --------
 |      numpy.ctypeslib
 |
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      Below are the public attributes of this object which were documented
 |      in "Guide to NumPy" (we have omitted undocumented public attributes,
 |      as well as documented private attributes):
 |
 |      .. autoattribute:: numpy.core._internal._ctypes.data
 |          :noindex:
 |
 |      .. autoattribute:: numpy.core._internal._ctypes.shape

 |          :noindex:
 |
 |      .. automethod:: numpy.core._internal._ctypes.strides_as
 |          :noindex:
 |
 |      If the ctypes module is not available, then the ctypes attribute
 |      of array objects still returns something useful, but ctypes objects
 |      are not returned and errors may be raised instead. In particular,
 |      the object will still have the ``as_parameter`` attribute which will
 |      return an integer equal to the data attribute.
 |
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      >>> import ctypes
 |      >>> x = np.array([[0, 1], [2, 3]], dtype=np.int32)
 |      >>> x
 |      array([[0, 1],

 |
 |  data
 |      Python buffer object pointing to the start of the array's data.

 |
 |      .. warning::
 |
 |          Setting ``arr.dtype`` is discouraged and may be deprecated in the
 |          future.  Setting will replace the ``dtype`` without modifying the

 |
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      None
 |
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      d : numpy dtype object
 |
 |      See Also

 |      ndarray.astype : Cast the values contained in the array to a new data-type.
 |      ndarray.view : Create a view of the same data but a different data-type.
 |      numpy.dtype
 |
 |      Examples

 |      >>> x.dtype
 |      dtype('int32')
 |      >>> type(x.dtype)
 |      <type 'numpy.dtype'>
 |
 |  flags
 |      Information about the memory layout of the array.
 |
 |      Attributes
 |      ----------
 |      C_CONTIGUOUS (C)
 |          The data is in a single, C-style contiguous segment.
 |      F_CONTIGUOUS (F)
 |          The data is in a single, Fortran-style contiguous segment.
 |      OWNDATA (O)
 |          The array owns the memory it uses or borrows it from another object.
 |      WRITEABLE (W)
 |          The data area can be written to.  Setting this to False locks
 |          the data, making it read-only.  A view (slice, etc.) inherits WRITEABLE
 |          from its base array at creation time, but a view of a writeable
 |          array may be subsequently locked while the base array remains writeable.
 |          (The opposite is not true, in that a view of a locked array may not
 |          be made writeable.  However, currently, locking a base object does not
 |          lock any views that already reference it, so under that circumstance it
 |          is possible to alter the contents of a locked array via a previously
 |          created writeable view onto it.)  Attempting to change a non-writeable
 |          array raises a RuntimeError exception.
 |      ALIGNED (A)
 |          The data and all elements are aligned appropriately for the hardware.
 |      WRITEBACKIFCOPY (X)
 |          This array is a copy of some other array. The C-API function
 |          PyArray_ResolveWritebackIfCopy must be called before deallocating
 |          to the base array will be updated with the contents of this array.
 |      FNC
 |          F_CONTIGUOUS and not C_CONTIGUOUS.
 |      FORC
 |          F_CONTIGUOUS or C_CONTIGUOUS (one-segment test).
 |      BEHAVED (B)
 |          ALIGNED and WRITEABLE.
 |      CARRAY (CA)
 |          BEHAVED and C_CONTIGUOUS.
 |      FARRAY (FA)
 |          BEHAVED and F_CONTIGUOUS and not C_CONTIGUOUS.
 |
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      The `flags` object can be accessed dictionary-like (as in ``a.flags['WRITEABLE']``),
 |      or by using lowercased attribute names (as in ``a.flags.writeable``). Short flag
 |      names are only supported in dictionary access.
 |
 |      Only the WRITEBACKIFCOPY, WRITEABLE, and ALIGNED flags can be
 |      changed by the user, via direct assignment to the attribute or dictionary
 |      entry, or by calling `ndarray.setflags`.
 |
 |      The array flags cannot be set arbitrarily:
 |
 |      - WRITEBACKIFCOPY can only be set ``False``.
 |      - ALIGNED can only be set ``True`` if the data is truly aligned.
 |      - WRITEABLE can only be set ``True`` if the array owns its own memory
 |        or the ultimate owner of the memory exposes a writeable buffer
 |        interface or is a string.
 |
 |      Arrays can be both C-style and Fortran-style contiguous simultaneously.
 |      This is clear for 1-dimensional arrays, but can also be true for higher
 |      dimensional arrays.
 |
 |      Even for contiguous arrays a stride for a given dimension
 |      ``arr.strides[dim]`` may be *arbitrary* if ``arr.shape[dim] == 1``
 |      or the array has no elements.
 |      It does *not* generally hold that ``self.strides[-1] == self.itemsize``
 |      for C-style contiguous arrays or ``self.strides[0] == self.itemsize`` for
 |      Fortran-style contiguous arrays is true.
 |
 |  flat
 |      A 1-D iterator over the array.
 |
 |      This is a `numpy.flatiter` instance, which acts similarly to, but is not
 |      a subclass of, Python's built-in iterator object.

 |  shape
 |      Tuple of array dimensions.
 |
 |      The shape property is usually used to get the current shape of an array,
 |      but may also be used to reshape the array in-place by assigning a tuple of
 |      array dimensions to it.  As with `numpy.reshape`, one of the new shape
 |      dimensions can be -1, in which case its value is inferred from the size of
 |      the array and the remaining dimensions. Reshaping an array in-place will
 |      fail if a copy is required.
 |
 |      .. warning::
 |
 |          Setting ``arr.shape`` is discouraged and may be deprecated in the
 |          future.  Using `ndarray.reshape` is the preferred approach.

 |      Equal to ``np.prod(a.shape)``, i.e., the product of the array's
 |      dimensions.
 |
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      `a.size` returns a standard arbitrary precision Python integer. This
 |      may not be the case with other methods of obtaining the same value
 |      (like the suggested ``np.prod(a.shape)``, which returns an instance
 |      of ``np.int_``), and may be relevant if the value is used further in
 |      calculations that may overflow a fixed size integer type.

 |  strides
 |      Tuple of bytes to step in each dimension when traversing an array.
 |
 |      The byte offset of element ``(i[0], i[1], ..., i[n])`` in an array `a`
 |      is::
 |
 |          offset = sum(np.array(i) * a.strides)
 |
 |      A more detailed explanation of strides can be found in the
 |      "ndarray.rst" file in the NumPy reference guide.
 |
 |      .. warning::
 |
 |          Setting ``arr.strides`` is discouraged and may be deprecated in the
 |          future.  `numpy.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided` should be preferred
 |          to create a new view of the same data in a safer way.
 |
 |      Notes
 |      -----
 |      Imagine an array of 32-bit integers (each 4 bytes)::
 |
 |        x = np.array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
 |                      [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]], dtype=np.int32)
 |
 |      This array is stored in memory as 40 bytes, one after the other
 |      (known as a contiguous block of memory).  The strides of an array tell
 |      us how many bytes we have to skip in memory to move to the next position
 |      along a certain axis.  For example, we have to skip 4 bytes (1 value) to
 |      move to the next column, but 20 bytes (5 values) to get to the same
 |      position in the next row.  As such, the strides for the array `x` will be
 |      ``(20, 4)``.

        Input array.  If it is not already an ndarray, a conversion is
        attempted.

    Returns
    -------
    number_of_dimensions : int

percentile(a, q, axis=None, out=None, overwrite_input=False, method='linear', keepdims=False, *, interpolation=None)
    Compute the q-th percentile of the data along the specified axis.

    Returns the q-th percentile(s) of the array elements.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like of real numbers
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    q : array_like of float
        Percentage or sequence of percentages for the percentiles to compute.
        Values must be between 0 and 100 inclusive.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the percentiles are computed. The
        default is to compute the percentile(s) along a flattened
        version of the array.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.9.0
            A tuple of axes is supported
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must
        have the same shape and buffer length as the expected output,
        but the type (of the output) will be cast if necessary.
    overwrite_input : bool, optional
        If True, then allow the input array `a` to be modified by intermediate
        calculations, to save memory. In this case, the contents of the input
        `a` after this function completes is undefined.
    method : str, optional
        This parameter specifies the method to use for estimating the
        percentile.  There are many different methods, some unique to NumPy.
        See the notes for explanation.  The options sorted by their R type
        as summarized in the H&F paper [1]_ are:

        1. 'inverted_cdf'
        2. 'averaged_inverted_cdf'
        3. 'closest_observation'
        4. 'interpolated_inverted_cdf'
        5. 'hazen'
        6. 'weibull'
        7. 'linear'  (default)
        8. 'median_unbiased'
        9. 'normal_unbiased'

        The first three methods are discontinuous.  NumPy further defines the
        following discontinuous variations of the default 'linear' (7.) option:

        * 'lower'
        * 'higher',
        * 'midpoint'
        * 'nearest'

        .. versionchanged:: 1.22.0
            This argument was previously called "interpolation" and only
            offered the "linear" default and last four options.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in
        the result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the
        result will broadcast correctly against the original array `a`.

        .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

    interpolation : str, optional
        Deprecated name for the method keyword argument.

        .. deprecated:: 1.22.0

    Returns
    -------
    percentile : scalar or ndarray
        If `q` is a single percentile and `axis=None`, then the result
        is a scalar. If multiple percentiles are given, first axis of
        the result corresponds to the percentiles. The other axes are
        the axes that remain after the reduction of `a`. If the input
        contains integers or floats smaller than ``float64``, the output
        data-type is ``float64``. Otherwise, the output data-type is the
        same as that of the input. If `out` is specified, that array is
        returned instead.

    See Also
    --------
    mean
    median : equivalent to ``percentile(..., 50)``
    nanpercentile
    quantile : equivalent to percentile, except q in the range [0, 1].

    Notes
    -----
    Given a vector ``V`` of length ``n``, the q-th percentile of ``V`` is
    the value ``q/100`` of the way from the minimum to the maximum in a
    sorted copy of ``V``. The values and distances of the two nearest
    neighbors as well as the `method` parameter will determine the
    percentile if the normalized ranking does not match the location of
    ``q`` exactly. This function is the same as the median if ``q=50``, the
    same as the minimum if ``q=0`` and the same as the maximum if
    ``q=100``.

    The optional `method` parameter specifies the method to use when the
    desired percentile lies between two indexes ``i`` and ``j = i + 1``.
    In that case, we first determine ``i + g``, a virtual index that lies
    between ``i`` and ``j``, where  ``i`` is the floor and ``g`` is the
    fractional part of the index. The final result is, then, an interpolation
    of ``a[i]`` and ``a[j]`` based on ``g``. During the computation of ``g``,
    ``i`` and ``j`` are modified using correction constants ``alpha`` and
    ``beta`` whose choices depend on the ``method`` used. Finally, note that
    since Python uses 0-based indexing, the code subtracts another 1 from the
    index internally.

    The following formula determines the virtual index ``i + g``, the location
    of the percentile in the sorted sample:

    .. math::
        i + g = (q / 100) * ( n - alpha - beta + 1 ) + alpha

    The different methods then work as follows

    inverted_cdf:
        method 1 of H&F [1]_.
        This method gives discontinuous results:

        * if g > 0 ; then take j
        * if g = 0 ; then take i

    averaged_inverted_cdf:
        method 2 of H&F [1]_.
        This method give discontinuous results:

        * if g > 0 ; then take j
        * if g = 0 ; then average between bounds

    closest_observation:
        method 3 of H&F [1]_.
        This method give discontinuous results:

        * if g > 0 ; then take j
        * if g = 0 and index is odd ; then take j
        * if g = 0 and index is even ; then take i

    interpolated_inverted_cdf:
        method 4 of H&F [1]_.
        This method give continuous results using:

        * alpha = 0
        * beta = 1

    hazen:
        method 5 of H&F [1]_.
        This method give continuous results using:

        * alpha = 1/2
        * beta = 1/2

    weibull:
        method 6 of H&F [1]_.
        This method give continuous results using:

        * alpha = 0
        * beta = 0

    linear:
        method 7 of H&F [1]_.
        This method give continuous results using:

        * alpha = 1
        * beta = 1

    median_unbiased:
        method 8 of H&F [1]_.
        This method is probably the best method if the sample
        distribution function is unknown (see reference).
        This method give continuous results using:

        * alpha = 1/3
        * beta = 1/3

    normal_unbiased:
        method 9 of H&F [1]_.
        This method is probably the best method if the sample
        distribution function is known to be normal.
        This method give continuous results using:

        * alpha = 3/8
        * beta = 3/8

    lower:
        NumPy method kept for backwards compatibility.
        Takes ``i`` as the interpolation point.

    higher:
        NumPy method kept for backwards compatibility.
        Takes ``j`` as the interpolation point.

    nearest:
        NumPy method kept for backwards compatibility.
        Takes ``i`` or ``j``, whichever is nearest.

    midpoint:
        NumPy method kept for backwards compatibility.
        Uses ``(i + j) / 2``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[10, 7, 4], [3, 2, 1]])
    >>> a
    array([[10,  7,  4],

    >>> np.percentile(b, 50, axis=1, overwrite_input=True)
    array([7.,  2.])
    >>> assert not np.all(a == b)

    The different methods can be visualized graphically:

poly(seq_of_zeros)
    Find the coefficients of a polynomial with the given sequence of roots.

    .. note::
       This forms part of the old polynomial API. Since version 1.4, the
       new polynomial API defined in `numpy.polynomial` is preferred.
       A summary of the differences can be found in the
       :doc:`transition guide </reference/routines.polynomials>`.

    Returns the coefficients of the polynomial whose leading coefficient
    is one for the given sequence of zeros (multiple roots must be included
    in the sequence as many times as their multiplicity; see Examples).
    A square matrix (or array, which will be treated as a matrix) can also
    be given, in which case the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial
    of the matrix are returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seq_of_zeros : array_like, shape (N,) or (N, N)
        A sequence of polynomial roots, or a square array or matrix object.

    Returns
    -------
    c : ndarray
        1D array of polynomial coefficients from highest to lowest degree:

        ``c[0] * x**(N) + c[1] * x**(N-1) + ... + c[N-1] * x + c[N]``
        where c[0] always equals 1.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If input is the wrong shape (the input must be a 1-D or square
        2-D array).

    the first one in the returned array - is always taken as one. (If
    for some reason you have one other point, the only automatic way
    presently to leverage that information is to use ``polyfit``.)

    The characteristic polynomial, :math:`p_a(t)`, of an `n`-by-`n`
    matrix **A** is given by

        :math:`p_a(t) = \mathrm{det}(t\, \mathbf{I} - \mathbf{A})`,

    where **I** is the `n`-by-`n` identity matrix. [2]_

polyder(p, m=1)
    Return the derivative of the specified order of a polynomial.

    .. note::
       This forms part of the old polynomial API. Since version 1.4, the
       new polynomial API defined in `numpy.polynomial` is preferred.
       A summary of the differences can be found in the
       :doc:`transition guide </reference/routines.polynomials>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    p : poly1d or sequence
        Polynomial to differentiate.
        A sequence is interpreted as polynomial coefficients, see `poly1d`.
    m : int, optional
        Order of differentiation (default: 1)

    Returns
    -------
    der : poly1d
        A new polynomial representing the derivative.

    See Also
    --------
    polyint : Anti-derivative of a polynomial.
    poly1d : Class for one-dimensional polynomials.

    Examples
    --------
    The derivative of the polynomial :math:`x^3 + x^2 + x^1 + 1` is:

    >>> p = np.poly1d([1,1,1,1])
    >>> p2 = np.polyder(p)
    >>> p2
    poly1d([3, 2, 1])

    which evaluates to:

    >>> p2(2.)
    17.0

    We can verify this, approximating the derivative with
    ``(f(x + h) - f(x))/h``:

    >>> (p(2. + 0.001) - p(2.)) / 0.001
    17.007000999997857

    The fourth-order derivative of a 3rd-order polynomial is zero:

polyfit(x, y, deg, rcond=None, full=False, w=None, cov=False)
    Least squares polynomial fit.

    .. note::
       This forms part of the old polynomial API. Since version 1.4, the
       new polynomial API defined in `numpy.polynomial` is preferred.
       A summary of the differences can be found in the
       :doc:`transition guide </reference/routines.polynomials>`.

    Fit a polynomial ``p(x) = p[0] * x**deg + ... + p[deg]`` of degree `deg`
    to points `(x, y)`. Returns a vector of coefficients `p` that minimises
    the squared error in the order `deg`, `deg-1`, ... `0`.

    The `Polynomial.fit <numpy.polynomial.polynomial.Polynomial.fit>` class
    method is recommended for new code as it is more stable numerically. See
    the documentation of the method for more information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, shape (M,)
        x-coordinates of the M sample points ``(x[i], y[i])``.
    y : array_like, shape (M,) or (M, K)
        y-coordinates of the sample points. Several data sets of sample
        points sharing the same x-coordinates can be fitted at once by
        passing in a 2D-array that contains one dataset per column.
    deg : int
        Degree of the fitting polynomial
    rcond : float, optional
        Relative condition number of the fit. Singular values smaller than
        this relative to the largest singular value will be ignored. The
        default value is len(x)*eps, where eps is the relative precision of
        the float type, about 2e-16 in most cases.
    full : bool, optional
        Switch determining nature of return value. When it is False (the
        default) just the coefficients are returned, when True diagnostic
        information from the singular value decomposition is also returned.
    w : array_like, shape (M,), optional
        Weights. If not None, the weight ``w[i]`` applies to the unsquared
        residual ``y[i] - y_hat[i]`` at ``x[i]``. Ideally the weights are
        chosen so that the errors of the products ``w[i]*y[i]`` all have the
        same variance.  When using inverse-variance weighting, use
        ``w[i] = 1/sigma(y[i])``.  The default value is None.
    cov : bool or str, optional
        If given and not `False`, return not just the estimate but also its
        covariance matrix. By default, the covariance are scaled by
        chi2/dof, where dof = M - (deg + 1), i.e., the weights are presumed
        to be unreliable except in a relative sense and everything is scaled
        such that the reduced chi2 is unity. This scaling is omitted if
        ``cov='unscaled'``, as is relevant for the case that the weights are
        w = 1/sigma, with sigma known to be a reliable estimate of the
        uncertainty.

    Returns
    -------
    p : ndarray, shape (deg + 1,) or (deg + 1, K)
        Polynomial coefficients, highest power first.  If `y` was 2-D, the
        coefficients for `k`-th data set are in ``p[:,k]``.

    residuals, rank, singular_values, rcond
        These values are only returned if ``full == True``

        - residuals -- sum of squared residuals of the least squares fit
        - rank -- the effective rank of the scaled Vandermonde
           coefficient matrix
        - singular_values -- singular values of the scaled Vandermonde
           coefficient matrix
        - rcond -- value of `rcond`.

        For more details, see `numpy.linalg.lstsq`.

    V : ndarray, shape (M,M) or (M,M,K)
        Present only if ``full == False`` and ``cov == True``.  The covariance
        matrix of the polynomial coefficient estimates.  The diagonal of
        this matrix are the variance estimates for each coefficient.  If y
        is a 2-D array, then the covariance matrix for the `k`-th data set
        are in ``V[:,:,k]``


    Warns
    -----
    RankWarning
        The rank of the coefficient matrix in the least-squares fit is
        deficient. The warning is only raised if ``full == False``.

        The warnings can be turned off by

        >>> import warnings
        >>> warnings.simplefilter('ignore', np.RankWarning)

    See Also
    --------
    polyval : Compute polynomial values.
    linalg.lstsq : Computes a least-squares fit.
    scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline : Computes spline fits.

    Notes
    -----
    The solution minimizes the squared error

    .. math::
        E = \sum_{j=0}^k |p(x_j) - y_j|^2

    in the equations::

        x[0]**n * p[0] + ... + x[0] * p[n-1] + p[n] = y[0]
        x[1]**n * p[0] + ... + x[1] * p[n-1] + p[n] = y[1]
        ...
        x[k]**n * p[0] + ... + x[k] * p[n-1] + p[n] = y[k]

    The coefficient matrix of the coefficients `p` is a Vandermonde matrix.

    `polyfit` issues a `RankWarning` when the least-squares fit is badly
    conditioned. This implies that the best fit is not well-defined due
    to numerical error. The results may be improved by lowering the polynomial
    degree or by replacing `x` by `x` - `x`.mean(). The `rcond` parameter
    can also be set to a value smaller than its default, but the resulting
    fit may be spurious: including contributions from the small singular
    values can add numerical noise to the result.

    Note that fitting polynomial coefficients is inherently badly conditioned
    when the degree of the polynomial is large or the interval of sample points
    is badly centered. The quality of the fit should always be checked in these
    cases. When polynomial fits are not satisfactory, splines may be a good
    alternative.

polyval(p, x)
    Evaluate a polynomial at specific values.

    .. note::
       This forms part of the old polynomial API. Since version 1.4, the
       new polynomial API defined in `numpy.polynomial` is preferred.
       A summary of the differences can be found in the
       :doc:`transition guide </reference/routines.polynomials>`.

    If `p` is of length N, this function returns the value:

        ``p[0]*x**(N-1) + p[1]*x**(N-2) + ... + p[N-2]*x + p[N-1]``

    If `x` is a sequence, then ``p(x)`` is returned for each element of ``x``.
    If `x` is another polynomial then the composite polynomial ``p(x(t))``
    is returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    p : array_like or poly1d object
       1D array of polynomial coefficients (including coefficients equal
       to zero) from highest degree to the constant term, or an
       instance of poly1d.
    x : array_like or poly1d object
       A number, an array of numbers, or an instance of poly1d, at
       which to evaluate `p`.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray or poly1d
       If `x` is a poly1d instance, the result is the composition of the two
       polynomials, i.e., `x` is "substituted" in `p` and the simplified
       result is returned. In addition, the type of `x` - array_like or
       poly1d - governs the type of the output: `x` array_like => `values`
       array_like, `x` a poly1d object => `values` is also.

    See Also
    --------
    poly1d: A polynomial class.

    Notes
    -----
    Horner's scheme [1]_ is used to evaluate the polynomial. Even so,
    for polynomials of high degree the values may be inaccurate due to
    rounding errors. Use carefully.

    If `x` is a subtype of `ndarray` the return value will be of the same type.

quantile(a, q, axis=None, out=None, overwrite_input=False, method='linear', keepdims=False, *, interpolation=None)
    Compute the q-th quantile of the data along the specified axis.

    .. versionadded:: 1.15.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like of real numbers
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    q : array_like of float
        Probability or sequence of probabilities for the quantiles to compute.
        Values must be between 0 and 1 inclusive.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the quantiles are computed. The default is
        to compute the quantile(s) along a flattened version of the array.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have
        the same shape and buffer length as the expected output, but the
        type (of the output) will be cast if necessary.
    overwrite_input : bool, optional
        If True, then allow the input array `a` to be modified by
        intermediate calculations, to save memory. In this case, the
        contents of the input `a` after this function completes is
        undefined.
    method : str, optional
        This parameter specifies the method to use for estimating the
        quantile.  There are many different methods, some unique to NumPy.
        See the notes for explanation.  The options sorted by their R type
        as summarized in the H&F paper [1]_ are:

        1. 'inverted_cdf'
        2. 'averaged_inverted_cdf'
        3. 'closest_observation'
        4. 'interpolated_inverted_cdf'
        5. 'hazen'
        6. 'weibull'
        7. 'linear'  (default)
        8. 'median_unbiased'
        9. 'normal_unbiased'

        The first three methods are discontinuous.  NumPy further defines the
        following discontinuous variations of the default 'linear' (7.) option:

        * 'lower'
        * 'higher',
        * 'midpoint'
        * 'nearest'

        .. versionchanged:: 1.22.0
            This argument was previously called "interpolation" and only
            offered the "linear" default and last four options.

    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in
        the result as dimensions with size one. With this option, the
        result will broadcast correctly against the original array `a`.

    interpolation : str, optional
        Deprecated name for the method keyword argument.

        .. deprecated:: 1.22.0

    Returns
    -------
    quantile : scalar or ndarray
        If `q` is a single probability and `axis=None`, then the result
        is a scalar. If multiple probabilies levels are given, first axis of
        the result corresponds to the quantiles. The other axes are
        the axes that remain after the reduction of `a`. If the input
        contains integers or floats smaller than ``float64``, the output
        data-type is ``float64``. Otherwise, the output data-type is the
        same as that of the input. If `out` is specified, that array is
        returned instead.

    See Also
    --------
    mean
    percentile : equivalent to quantile, but with q in the range [0, 100].
    median : equivalent to ``quantile(..., 0.5)``
    nanquantile

    Notes
    -----
    Given a vector ``V`` of length ``n``, the q-th quantile of ``V`` is
    the value ``q`` of the way from the minimum to the maximum in a
    sorted copy of ``V``. The values and distances of the two nearest
    neighbors as well as the `method` parameter will determine the
    quantile if the normalized ranking does not match the location of
    ``q`` exactly. This function is the same as the median if ``q=0.5``, the
    same as the minimum if ``q=0.0`` and the same as the maximum if
    ``q=1.0``.

    The optional `method` parameter specifies the method to use when the
    desired quantile lies between two indexes ``i`` and ``j = i + 1``.
    In that case, we first determine ``i + g``, a virtual index that lies
    between ``i`` and ``j``, where  ``i`` is the floor and ``g`` is the
    fractional part of the index. The final result is, then, an interpolation
    of ``a[i]`` and ``a[j]`` based on ``g``. During the computation of ``g``,
    ``i`` and ``j`` are modified using correction constants ``alpha`` and
    ``beta`` whose choices depend on the ``method`` used. Finally, note that
    since Python uses 0-based indexing, the code subtracts another 1 from the
    index internally.

    The following formula determines the virtual index ``i + g``, the location
    of the quantile in the sorted sample:

    .. math::
        i + g = q * ( n - alpha - beta + 1 ) + alpha

    The different methods then work as follows

    inverted_cdf:
        method 1 of H&F [1]_.
        This method gives discontinuous results:

        * if g > 0 ; then take j
        * if g = 0 ; then take i

    averaged_inverted_cdf:
        method 2 of H&F [1]_.
        This method gives discontinuous results:

        * if g > 0 ; then take j
        * if g = 0 ; then average between bounds

    closest_observation:
        method 3 of H&F [1]_.
        This method gives discontinuous results:

        * if g > 0 ; then take j
        * if g = 0 and index is odd ; then take j
        * if g = 0 and index is even ; then take i

    interpolated_inverted_cdf:
        method 4 of H&F [1]_.
        This method gives continuous results using:

        * alpha = 0
        * beta = 1

    hazen:
        method 5 of H&F [1]_.
        This method gives continuous results using:

        * alpha = 1/2
        * beta = 1/2

    weibull:
        method 6 of H&F [1]_.
        This method gives continuous results using:

        * alpha = 0
        * beta = 0

    linear:
        method 7 of H&F [1]_.
        This method gives continuous results using:

        * alpha = 1
        * beta = 1

    median_unbiased:
        method 8 of H&F [1]_.
        This method is probably the best method if the sample
        distribution function is unknown (see reference).
        This method gives continuous results using:

        * alpha = 1/3
        * beta = 1/3

    normal_unbiased:
        method 9 of H&F [1]_.
        This method is probably the best method if the sample
        distribution function is known to be normal.
        This method gives continuous results using:

        * alpha = 3/8
        * beta = 3/8

    lower:
        NumPy method kept for backwards compatibility.
        Takes ``i`` as the interpolation point.

    higher:
        NumPy method kept for backwards compatibility.
        Takes ``j`` as the interpolation point.

    nearest:
        NumPy method kept for backwards compatibility.
        Takes ``i`` or ``j``, whichever is nearest.

    midpoint:
        NumPy method kept for backwards compatibility.
        Uses ``(i + j) / 2``.

    For backwards compatibility with previous versions of numpy before 1.17, the
    various aliases to the global `RandomState` methods are left alone and do not
    use the new `Generator` API.

    class BitGenerator(builtins.object)
     |  BitGenerator(seed=None)
     |
     |  Base Class for generic BitGenerators, which provide a stream
     |  of random bits based on different algorithms. Must be overridden.
     |
     |  Parameters
     |  ----------
     |  seed : {None, int, array_like[ints], SeedSequence}, optional
     |      A seed to initialize the `BitGenerator`. If None, then fresh,
     |      unpredictable entropy will be pulled from the OS. If an ``int`` or
     |      ``array_like[ints]`` is passed, then it will be passed to
     |      `~numpy.random.SeedSequence` to derive the initial `BitGenerator` state.
     |      One may also pass in a `SeedSequence` instance.
     |      All integer values must be non-negative.
     |
     |  Attributes
     |  ----------
     |  lock : threading.Lock
     |      Lock instance that is shared so that the same BitGenerator can
     |      be used in multiple Generators without corrupting the state. Code that
     |      generates values from a bit generator should hold the bit generator's
     |      lock.

     |  random_raw(...)
     |      random_raw(self, size=None)
     |
     |      Return randoms as generated by the underlying BitGenerator
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
     |          single value is returned.
     |      output : bool, optional
     |          Output values.  Used for performance testing since the generated
     |          values are not returned.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : uint or ndarray
     |          Drawn samples.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      This method directly exposes the raw underlying pseudo-random
     |      number generator. All values are returned as unsigned 64-bit
     |      values irrespective of the number of bits produced by the PRNG.
     |
     |      See the class docstring for the number of bits returned.
     |
     |  spawn(...)
     |      spawn(n_children)
     |
     |      Create new independent child bit generators.
     |
     |      See :ref:`seedsequence-spawn` for additional notes on spawning
     |      children.  Some bit generators also implement ``jumped``
     |      as a different approach for creating independent streams.

     |
     |  ``Generator`` exposes a number of methods for generating random
     |  numbers drawn from a variety of probability distributions. In addition to
     |  the distribution-specific arguments, each method takes a keyword argument
     |  `size` that defaults to ``None``. If `size` is ``None``, then a single
     |  value is generated and returned. If `size` is an integer, then a 1-D
     |  array filled with generated values is returned. If `size` is a tuple,
     |  then an array with that shape is filled and returned.
     |
     |  The function :func:`numpy.random.default_rng` will instantiate
     |  a `Generator` with numpy's default `BitGenerator`.
     |
     |  **No Compatibility Guarantee**
     |
     |  ``Generator`` does not provide a version compatibility guarantee. In
     |  particular, as better algorithms evolve the bit stream may change.
     |
     |  Parameters
     |  ----------
     |  bit_generator : BitGenerator
     |      BitGenerator to use as the core generator.
     |
     |  Notes
     |  -----
     |  The Python stdlib module `random` contains pseudo-random number generator
     |  with a number of methods that are similar to the ones available in
     |  ``Generator``. It uses Mersenne Twister, and this bit generator can
     |  be accessed using ``MT19937``. ``Generator``, besides being
     |  NumPy-aware, has the advantage that it provides a much larger number
     |  of probability distributions to choose from.
     |
     |  Examples
     |  --------
     |  >>> from numpy.random import Generator, PCG64
     |  >>> rng = Generator(PCG64())
     |  >>> rng.standard_normal()
     |  -0.203  # random

     |
     |  beta(...)
     |      beta(a, b, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from a Beta distribution.
     |
     |      The Beta distribution is a special case of the Dirichlet distribution,
     |      and is related to the Gamma distribution.  It has the probability
     |      distribution function
     |
     |      .. math:: f(x; a,b) = \frac{1}{B(\alpha, \beta)} x^{\alpha - 1}
     |                                                       (1 - x)^{\beta - 1},
     |
     |      where the normalization, B, is the beta function,
     |
     |      .. math:: B(\alpha, \beta) = \int_0^1 t^{\alpha - 1}
     |                                   (1 - t)^{\beta - 1} dt.
     |
     |      It is often seen in Bayesian inference and order statistics.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      a : float or array_like of floats
     |          Alpha, positive (>0).
     |      b : float or array_like of floats
     |          Beta, positive (>0).
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``a`` and ``b`` are both scalars.
     |          Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(a, b).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized beta distribution.
     |
     |  binomial(...)
     |      binomial(n, p, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from a binomial distribution.
     |
     |      Samples are drawn from a binomial distribution with specified
     |      parameters, n trials and p probability of success where
     |      n an integer >= 0 and p is in the interval [0,1]. (n may be
     |      input as a float, but it is truncated to an integer in use)
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      n : int or array_like of ints
     |          Parameter of the distribution, >= 0. Floats are also accepted,
     |          but they will be truncated to integers.
     |      p : float or array_like of floats
     |          Parameter of the distribution, >= 0 and <=1.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``n`` and ``p`` are both scalars.
     |          Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(n, p).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized binomial distribution, where
     |          each sample is equal to the number of successes over the n trials.
     |
     |      See Also
     |      --------
     |      scipy.stats.binom : probability density function, distribution or
     |          cumulative density function, etc.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density for the binomial distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: P(N) = \binom{n}{N}p^N(1-p)^{n-N},
     |
     |      where :math:`n` is the number of trials, :math:`p` is the probability
     |      of success, and :math:`N` is the number of successes.
     |
     |      When estimating the standard error of a proportion in a population by
     |      using a random sample, the normal distribution works well unless the
     |      product p*n <=5, where p = population proportion estimate, and n =
     |      number of samples, in which case the binomial distribution is used
     |      instead. For example, a sample of 15 people shows 4 who are left
     |      handed, and 11 who are right handed. Then p = 4/15 = 27%. 0.27*15 = 4,
     |      so the binomial distribution should be used in this case.

     |      wells fail. What is the probability of that happening?
     |
     |      Let's do 20,000 trials of the model, and count the number that
     |      generate zero positive results.
     |
     |      >>> sum(rng.binomial(9, 0.1, 20000) == 0)/20000.

     |      bytes(length)
     |
     |      Return random bytes.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      length : int
     |          Number of random bytes.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : bytes
     |          String of length `length`.

     |  chisquare(...)
     |      chisquare(df, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from a chi-square distribution.
     |
     |      When `df` independent random variables, each with standard normal
     |      distributions (mean 0, variance 1), are squared and summed, the
     |      resulting distribution is chi-square (see Notes).  This distribution
     |      is often used in hypothesis testing.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      df : float or array_like of floats
     |           Number of degrees of freedom, must be > 0.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``df`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
     |          ``np.array(df).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized chi-square distribution.
     |
     |      Raises
     |      ------
     |      ValueError
     |          When `df` <= 0 or when an inappropriate `size` (e.g. ``size=-1``)
     |          is given.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The variable obtained by summing the squares of `df` independent,
     |      standard normally distributed random variables:
     |
     |      .. math:: Q = \sum_{i=0}^{\mathtt{df}} X^2_i
     |
     |      is chi-square distributed, denoted
     |
     |      .. math:: Q \sim \chi^2_k.

     |  choice(...)
     |      choice(a, size=None, replace=True, p=None, axis=0, shuffle=True)
     |
     |      Generates a random sample from a given array
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      a : {array_like, int}
     |          If an ndarray, a random sample is generated from its elements.
     |          If an int, the random sample is generated from np.arange(a).
     |      size : {int, tuple[int]}, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn from the 1-d `a`. If `a` has more
     |          than one dimension, the `size` shape will be inserted into the
     |          `axis` dimension, so the output ``ndim`` will be ``a.ndim - 1 +
     |          len(size)``. Default is None, in which case a single value is
     |          returned.
     |      replace : bool, optional
     |          Whether the sample is with or without replacement. Default is True,
     |          meaning that a value of ``a`` can be selected multiple times.
     |      p : 1-D array_like, optional
     |          The probabilities associated with each entry in a.
     |          If not given, the sample assumes a uniform distribution over all
     |          entries in ``a``.
     |      axis : int, optional
     |          The axis along which the selection is performed. The default, 0,
     |          selects by row.
     |      shuffle : bool, optional
     |          Whether the sample is shuffled when sampling without replacement.
     |          Default is True, False provides a speedup.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      samples : single item or ndarray
     |          The generated random samples
     |
     |      Raises
     |      ------
     |      ValueError
     |          If a is an int and less than zero, if p is not 1-dimensional, if
     |          a is array-like with a size 0, if p is not a vector of
     |          probabilities, if a and p have different lengths, or if
     |          replace=False and the sample size is greater than the population
     |          size.

     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      Setting user-specified probabilities through ``p`` uses a more general but less
     |      efficient sampler than the default. The general sampler produces a different sample
     |      than the optimized sampler even if each element of ``p`` is 1 / len(a).
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      Generate a uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size 3:
     |
     |      >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
     |      >>> rng.choice(5, 3)
     |      array([0, 3, 4]) # random
     |      >>> #This is equivalent to rng.integers(0,5,3)
     |
     |      Generate a non-uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size 3:
     |
     |      >>> rng.choice(5, 3, p=[0.1, 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0])
     |      array([3, 3, 0]) # random
     |
     |      Generate a uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size 3 without
     |      replacement:
     |
     |      >>> rng.choice(5, 3, replace=False)
     |      array([3,1,0]) # random
     |      >>> #This is equivalent to rng.permutation(np.arange(5))[:3]
     |
     |      Generate a uniform random sample from a 2-D array along the first
     |      axis (the default), without replacement:
     |
     |      >>> rng.choice([[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]], 2, replace=False)
     |      array([[3, 4, 5], # random
     |             [0, 1, 2]])
     |
     |      Generate a non-uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size
     |      3 without replacement:
     |
     |      >>> rng.choice(5, 3, replace=False, p=[0.1, 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0])
     |      array([2, 3, 0]) # random
     |
     |      Any of the above can be repeated with an arbitrary array-like
     |      instead of just integers. For instance:
     |
     |      >>> aa_milne_arr = ['pooh', 'rabbit', 'piglet', 'Christopher']
     |      >>> rng.choice(aa_milne_arr, 5, p=[0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 0.3])
     |      array(['pooh', 'pooh', 'pooh', 'Christopher', 'piglet'], # random
     |            dtype='<U11')

     |  dirichlet(...)
     |      dirichlet(alpha, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from the Dirichlet distribution.
     |
     |      Draw `size` samples of dimension k from a Dirichlet distribution. A
     |      Dirichlet-distributed random variable can be seen as a multivariate
     |      generalization of a Beta distribution. The Dirichlet distribution
     |      is a conjugate prior of a multinomial distribution in Bayesian
     |      inference.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      alpha : sequence of floats, length k
     |          Parameter of the distribution (length ``k`` for sample of
     |          length ``k``).
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
     |          vector of length ``k`` is returned.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      samples : ndarray,
     |          The drawn samples, of shape ``(size, k)``.
     |
     |      Raises
     |      ------
     |      ValueError
     |          If any value in ``alpha`` is less than zero
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The Dirichlet distribution is a distribution over vectors
     |      :math:`x` that fulfil the conditions :math:`x_i>0` and
     |      :math:`\sum_{i=1}^k x_i = 1`.
     |
     |      The probability density function :math:`p` of a
     |      Dirichlet-distributed random vector :math:`X` is
     |      proportional to
     |
     |      .. math:: p(x) \propto \prod_{i=1}^{k}{x^{\alpha_i-1}_i},
     |
     |      where :math:`\alpha` is a vector containing the positive
     |      concentration parameters.
     |
     |      The method uses the following property for computation: let :math:`Y`
     |      be a random vector which has components that follow a standard gamma
     |      distribution, then :math:`X = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^k{Y_i}} Y`
     |      is Dirichlet-distributed

     |  exponential(...)
     |      exponential(scale=1.0, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from an exponential distribution.
     |
     |      Its probability density function is
     |
     |      .. math:: f(x; \frac{1}{\beta}) = \frac{1}{\beta} \exp(-\frac{x}{\beta}),
     |
     |      for ``x > 0`` and 0 elsewhere. :math:`\beta` is the scale parameter,
     |      which is the inverse of the rate parameter :math:`\lambda = 1/\beta`.
     |      The rate parameter is an alternative, widely used parameterization
     |      of the exponential distribution [3]_.
     |
     |      The exponential distribution is a continuous analogue of the
     |      geometric distribution.  It describes many common situations, such as
     |      the size of raindrops measured over many rainstorms [1]_, or the time
     |      between page requests to Wikipedia [2]_.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      scale : float or array_like of floats
     |          The scale parameter, :math:`\beta = 1/\lambda`. Must be
     |          non-negative.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``scale`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
     |          ``np.array(scale).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized exponential distribution.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      A real world example: Assume a company has 10000 customer support
     |      agents and the average time between customer calls is 4 minutes.
     |
     |      >>> n = 10000
     |      >>> time_between_calls = np.random.default_rng().exponential(scale=4, size=n)
     |
     |      What is the probability that a customer will call in the next
     |      4 to 5 minutes?
     |
     |      >>> x = ((time_between_calls < 5).sum())/n
     |      >>> y = ((time_between_calls < 4).sum())/n
     |      >>> x-y
     |      0.08 # may vary

     |  f(...)
     |      f(dfnum, dfden, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from an F distribution.
     |
     |      Samples are drawn from an F distribution with specified parameters,
     |      `dfnum` (degrees of freedom in numerator) and `dfden` (degrees of
     |      freedom in denominator), where both parameters must be greater than
     |      zero.
     |
     |      The random variate of the F distribution (also known as the
     |      Fisher distribution) is a continuous probability distribution
     |      that arises in ANOVA tests, and is the ratio of two chi-square
     |      variates.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      dfnum : float or array_like of floats
     |          Degrees of freedom in numerator, must be > 0.
     |      dfden : float or array_like of float
     |          Degrees of freedom in denominator, must be > 0.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``dfnum`` and ``dfden`` are both scalars.
     |          Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(dfnum, dfden).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized Fisher distribution.

     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The F statistic is used to compare in-group variances to between-group
     |      variances. Calculating the distribution depends on the sampling, and
     |      so it is a function of the respective degrees of freedom in the
     |      problem.  The variable `dfnum` is the number of samples minus one, the
     |      between-groups degrees of freedom, while `dfden` is the within-groups
     |      degrees of freedom, the sum of the number of samples in each group
     |      minus the number of groups.

     |             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-distribution
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      An example from Glantz[1], pp 47-40:
     |
     |      Two groups, children of diabetics (25 people) and children from people
     |      without diabetes (25 controls). Fasting blood glucose was measured,
     |      case group had a mean value of 86.1, controls had a mean value of
     |      82.2. Standard deviations were 2.09 and 2.49 respectively. Are these
     |      data consistent with the null hypothesis that the parents diabetic
     |      status does not affect their children's blood glucose levels?
     |      Calculating the F statistic from the data gives a value of 36.01.
     |
     |      Draw samples from the distribution:
     |
     |      >>> dfnum = 1. # between group degrees of freedom
     |      >>> dfden = 48. # within groups degrees of freedom
     |      >>> s = np.random.default_rng().f(dfnum, dfden, 1000)
     |
     |      The lower bound for the top 1% of the samples is :
     |
     |      >>> np.sort(s)[-10]
     |      7.61988120985 # random
     |
     |      So there is about a 1% chance that the F statistic will exceed 7.62,
     |      the measured value is 36, so the null hypothesis is rejected at the 1%
     |      level.
     |
     |  gamma(...)
     |      gamma(shape, scale=1.0, size=None)

     |      `shape` (sometimes designated "k") and `scale` (sometimes designated
     |      "theta"), where both parameters are > 0.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      shape : float or array_like of floats
     |          The shape of the gamma distribution. Must be non-negative.
     |      scale : float or array_like of floats, optional
     |          The scale of the gamma distribution. Must be non-negative.
     |          Default is equal to 1.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``shape`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
     |          Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(shape, scale).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized gamma distribution.

     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density for the Gamma distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: p(x) = x^{k-1}\frac{e^{-x/\theta}}{\theta^k\Gamma(k)},
     |
     |      where :math:`k` is the shape and :math:`\theta` the scale,
     |      and :math:`\Gamma` is the Gamma function.
     |
     |      The Gamma distribution is often used to model the times to failure of
     |      electronic components, and arises naturally in processes for which the
     |      waiting times between Poisson distributed events are relevant.

     |  geometric(...)
     |      geometric(p, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from the geometric distribution.
     |
     |      Bernoulli trials are experiments with one of two outcomes:
     |      success or failure (an example of such an experiment is flipping
     |      a coin).  The geometric distribution models the number of trials
     |      that must be run in order to achieve success.  It is therefore
     |      supported on the positive integers, ``k = 1, 2, ...``.
     |
     |      The probability mass function of the geometric distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: f(k) = (1 - p)^{k - 1} p
     |
     |      where `p` is the probability of success of an individual trial.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      p : float or array_like of floats
     |          The probability of success of an individual trial.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``p`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
     |          ``np.array(p).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar

     |      with the probability of an individual success equal to 0.35:

     |      >>> z = np.random.default_rng().geometric(p=0.35, size=10000)

     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The Gumbel (or Smallest Extreme Value (SEV) or the Smallest Extreme
     |      Value Type I) distribution is one of a class of Generalized Extreme
     |      Value (GEV) distributions used in modeling extreme value problems.
     |      The Gumbel is a special case of the Extreme Value Type I distribution
     |      for maximums from distributions with "exponential-like" tails.
     |
     |      The probability density for the Gumbel distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: p(x) = \frac{e^{-(x - \mu)/ \beta}}{\beta} e^{ -e^{-(x - \mu)/
     |                \beta}},
     |
     |      where :math:`\mu` is the mode, a location parameter, and
     |      :math:`\beta` is the scale parameter.
     |
     |      The Gumbel (named for German mathematician Emil Julius Gumbel) was used
     |      very early in the hydrology literature, for modeling the occurrence of
     |      flood events. It is also used for modeling maximum wind speed and
     |      rainfall rates.  It is a "fat-tailed" distribution - the probability of
     |      an event in the tail of the distribution is larger than if one used a
     |      Gaussian, hence the surprisingly frequent occurrence of 100-year
     |      floods. Floods were initially modeled as a Gaussian process, which
     |      underestimated the frequency of extreme events.
     |
     |      It is one of a class of extreme value distributions, the Generalized
     |      Extreme Value (GEV) distributions, which also includes the Weibull and
     |      Frechet.
     |
     |      The function has a mean of :math:`\mu + 0.57721\beta` and a variance
     |      of :math:`\frac{\pi^2}{6}\beta^2`.

     |  hypergeometric(...)
     |      hypergeometric(ngood, nbad, nsample, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from a Hypergeometric distribution.
     |
     |      Samples are drawn from a hypergeometric distribution with specified
     |      parameters, `ngood` (ways to make a good selection), `nbad` (ways to make
     |      a bad selection), and `nsample` (number of items sampled, which is less
     |      than or equal to the sum ``ngood + nbad``).
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      ngood : int or array_like of ints
     |          Number of ways to make a good selection.  Must be nonnegative and
     |          less than 10**9.
     |      nbad : int or array_like of ints
     |          Number of ways to make a bad selection.  Must be nonnegative and
     |          less than 10**9.
     |      nsample : int or array_like of ints
     |          Number of items sampled.  Must be nonnegative and less than
     |          ``ngood + nbad``.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if `ngood`, `nbad`, and `nsample`
     |          are all scalars.  Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(ngood, nbad, nsample).size``
     |          samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized hypergeometric distribution. Each
     |          sample is the number of good items within a randomly selected subset of
     |          size `nsample` taken from a set of `ngood` good items and `nbad` bad items.

     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density for the Hypergeometric distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: P(x) = \frac{\binom{g}{x}\binom{b}{n-x}}{\binom{g+b}{n}},
     |
     |      where :math:`0 \le x \le n` and :math:`n-b \le x \le g`
     |
     |      for P(x) the probability of ``x`` good results in the drawn sample,
     |      g = `ngood`, b = `nbad`, and n = `nsample`.
     |
     |      Consider an urn with black and white marbles in it, `ngood` of them
     |      are black and `nbad` are white. If you draw `nsample` balls without
     |      replacement, then the hypergeometric distribution describes the
     |      distribution of black balls in the drawn sample.
     |
     |      Note that this distribution is very similar to the binomial
     |      distribution, except that in this case, samples are drawn without
     |      replacement, whereas in the Binomial case samples are drawn with
     |      replacement (or the sample space is infinite). As the sample space
     |      becomes large, this distribution approaches the binomial.
     |
     |      The arguments `ngood` and `nbad` each must be less than `10**9`. For
     |      extremely large arguments, the algorithm that is used to compute the
     |      samples [4]_ breaks down because of loss of precision in floating point
     |      calculations.  For such large values, if `nsample` is not also large,
     |      the distribution can be approximated with the binomial distribution,
     |      `binomial(n=nsample, p=ngood/(ngood + nbad))`.

     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      Draw samples from the distribution:
     |
     |      >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
     |      >>> ngood, nbad, nsamp = 100, 2, 10
     |      # number of good, number of bad, and number of samples

     |      #   note that it is very unlikely to grab both bad items
     |

     |  integers(...)
     |      integers(low, high=None, size=None, dtype=np.int64, endpoint=False)
     |
     |      Return random integers from `low` (inclusive) to `high` (exclusive), or
     |      if endpoint=True, `low` (inclusive) to `high` (inclusive). Replaces
     |      `RandomState.randint` (with endpoint=False) and
     |      `RandomState.random_integers` (with endpoint=True)
     |
     |      Return random integers from the "discrete uniform" distribution of
     |      the specified dtype. If `high` is None (the default), then results are
     |      from 0 to `low`.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      low : int or array-like of ints
     |          Lowest (signed) integers to be drawn from the distribution (unless
     |          ``high=None``, in which case this parameter is 0 and this value is
     |          used for `high`).
     |      high : int or array-like of ints, optional
     |          If provided, one above the largest (signed) integer to be drawn
     |          from the distribution (see above for behavior if ``high=None``).
     |          If array-like, must contain integer values
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
     |          single value is returned.
     |      dtype : dtype, optional
     |          Desired dtype of the result. Byteorder must be native.
     |          The default value is np.int64.
     |      endpoint : bool, optional
     |          If true, sample from the interval [low, high] instead of the
     |          default [low, high)
     |          Defaults to False
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : int or ndarray of ints
     |          `size`-shaped array of random integers from the appropriate
     |          distribution, or a single such random int if `size` not provided.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      When using broadcasting with uint64 dtypes, the maximum value (2**64)
     |      cannot be represented as a standard integer type. The high array (or
     |      low if high is None) must have object dtype, e.g., array([2**64]).
     |

     |      --------
     |      >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
     |      >>> rng.integers(2, size=10)
     |      array([1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0])  # random

     |  laplace(...)
     |      laplace(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from the Laplace or double exponential distribution with
     |      specified location (or mean) and scale (decay).
     |
     |      The Laplace distribution is similar to the Gaussian/normal distribution,
     |      but is sharper at the peak and has fatter tails. It represents the
     |      difference between two independent, identically distributed exponential
     |      random variables.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      loc : float or array_like of floats, optional
     |          The position, :math:`\mu`, of the distribution peak. Default is 0.
     |      scale : float or array_like of floats, optional
     |          :math:`\lambda`, the exponential decay. Default is 1. Must be non-
     |          negative.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``loc`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
     |          Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(loc, scale).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized Laplace distribution.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      It has the probability density function
     |
     |      .. math:: f(x; \mu, \lambda) = \frac{1}{2\lambda}
     |                                     \exp\left(-\frac{|x - \mu|}{\lambda}\right).
     |
     |      The first law of Laplace, from 1774, states that the frequency
     |      of an error can be expressed as an exponential function of the
     |      absolute magnitude of the error, which leads to the Laplace
     |      distribution. For many problems in economics and health
     |      sciences, this distribution seems to model the data better
     |      than the standard Gaussian distribution.

     |      Notes

     |      The probability density for the Logistic distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: P(x) = P(x) = \frac{e^{-(x-\mu)/s}}{s(1+e^{-(x-\mu)/s})^2},
     |
     |      where :math:`\mu` = location and :math:`s` = scale.
     |
     |      The Logistic distribution is used in Extreme Value problems where it
     |      can act as a mixture of Gumbel distributions, in Epidemiology, and by
     |      the World Chess Federation (FIDE) where it is used in the Elo ranking
     |      system, assuming the performance of each player is a logistically
     |      distributed random variable.

     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      A variable `x` has a log-normal distribution if `log(x)` is normally
     |      distributed.  The probability density function for the log-normal
     |      distribution is:
     |
     |      .. math:: p(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma x \sqrt{2\pi}}
     |                       e^{(-\frac{(ln(x)-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2})}
     |
     |      where :math:`\mu` is the mean and :math:`\sigma` is the standard
     |      deviation of the normally distributed logarithm of the variable.
     |      A log-normal distribution results if a random variable is the *product*
     |      of a large number of independent, identically-distributed variables in
     |      the same way that a normal distribution results if the variable is the
     |      *sum* of a large number of independent, identically-distributed
     |      variables.

     |      multinomial(n, pvals, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from a multinomial distribution.
     |
     |      The multinomial distribution is a multivariate generalization of the
     |      binomial distribution.  Take an experiment with one of ``p``
     |      possible outcomes.  An example of such an experiment is throwing a dice,
     |      where the outcome can be 1 through 6.  Each sample drawn from the
     |      distribution represents `n` such experiments.  Its values,
     |      ``X_i = [X_0, X_1, ..., X_p]``, represent the number of times the
     |      outcome was ``i``.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      n : int or array-like of ints
     |          Number of experiments.
     |      pvals : array-like of floats
     |          Probabilities of each of the ``p`` different outcomes with shape
     |          ``(k0, k1, ..., kn, p)``. Each element ``pvals[i,j,...,:]`` must
     |          sum to 1 (however, the last element is always assumed to account
     |          for the remaining probability, as long as
     |          ``sum(pvals[..., :-1], axis=-1) <= 1.0``. Must have at least 1
     |          dimension where pvals.shape[-1] > 0.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn each with ``p`` elements. Default
     |          is None where the output size is determined by the broadcast shape
     |          of ``n`` and all by the final dimension of ``pvals``, which is
     |          denoted as ``b=(b0, b1, ..., bq)``. If size is not None, then it
     |          must be compatible with the broadcast shape ``b``. Specifically,
     |          size must have ``q`` or more elements and size[-(q-j):] must equal
     |          ``bj``.

     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray
     |          The drawn samples, of shape size, if provided. When size is
     |          provided, the output shape is size + (p,)  If not specified,
     |          the shape is determined by the broadcast shape of ``n`` and
     |          ``pvals``, ``(b0, b1, ..., bq)`` augmented with the dimension of
     |          the multinomial, ``p``, so that that output shape is
     |          ``(b0, b1, ..., bq, p)``.
     |
     |          Each entry ``out[i,j,...,:]`` is a ``p``-dimensional value drawn
     |          from the distribution.

     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      Throw a dice 20 times:
     |
     |      >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
     |      >>> rng.multinomial(20, [1/6.]*6, size=1)
     |      array([[4, 1, 7, 5, 2, 1]])  # random
     |
     |      It landed 4 times on 1, once on 2, etc.
     |
     |      Now, throw the dice 20 times, and 20 times again:
     |
     |      >>> rng.multinomial(20, [1/6.]*6, size=2)
     |      array([[3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3],
     |             [2, 4, 3, 4, 0, 7]])  # random
     |
     |      For the first run, we threw 3 times 1, 4 times 2, etc.  For the second,
     |      we threw 2 times 1, 4 times 2, etc.
     |
     |      Now, do one experiment throwing the dice 10 time, and 10 times again,
     |      and another throwing the dice 20 times, and 20 times again:
     |
     |      >>> rng.multinomial([[10], [20]], [1/6.]*6, size=(2, 2))
     |      array([[[2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 1],
     |              [1, 3, 0, 3, 1, 2]],
     |             [[1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3],
     |              [3, 3, 2, 5, 5, 2]]])  # random
     |
     |      The first array shows the outcomes of throwing the dice 10 times, and
     |      the second shows the outcomes from throwing the dice 20 times.
     |
     |      A loaded die is more likely to land on number 6:
     |
     |      >>> rng.multinomial(100, [1/7.]*5 + [2/7.])
     |      array([11, 16, 14, 17, 16, 26])  # random
     |
     |      Simulate 10 throws of a 4-sided die and 20 throws of a 6-sided die
     |
     |      >>> rng.multinomial([10, 20],[[1/4]*4 + [0]*2, [1/6]*6])
     |      array([[2, 1, 4, 3, 0, 0],
     |             [3, 3, 3, 6, 1, 4]], dtype=int64)  # random
     |
     |      Generate categorical random variates from two categories where the
     |      first has 3 outcomes and the second has 2.
     |
     |      >>> rng.multinomial(1, [[.1, .5, .4 ], [.3, .7, .0]])
     |      array([[0, 0, 1],
     |             [0, 1, 0]], dtype=int64)  # random
     |
     |      ``argmax(axis=-1)`` is then used to return the categories.
     |
     |      >>> pvals = [[.1, .5, .4 ], [.3, .7, .0]]
     |      >>> rvs = rng.multinomial(1, pvals, size=(4,2))
     |      >>> rvs.argmax(axis=-1)
     |      array([[0, 1],
     |             [2, 0],
     |             [2, 1],
     |             [2, 0]], dtype=int64)  # random
     |
     |      The same output dimension can be produced using broadcasting.
     |
     |      >>> rvs = rng.multinomial([[1]] * 4, pvals)
     |      >>> rvs.argmax(axis=-1)
     |      array([[0, 1],
     |             [2, 0],
     |             [2, 1],
     |             [2, 0]], dtype=int64)  # random
     |
     |      The probability inputs should be normalized. As an implementation
     |      detail, the value of the last entry is ignored and assumed to take
     |      up any leftover probability mass, but this should not be relied on.
     |      A biased coin which has twice as much weight on one side as on the
     |      other should be sampled like so:

     |      array([38, 62])  # random
     |
     |      not like:
     |
     |      >>> rng.multinomial(100, [1.0, 2.0])  # WRONG

     |      multivariate_hypergeometric(colors, nsample, size=None,
     |                                  method='marginals')
     |
     |      Generate variates from a multivariate hypergeometric distribution.
     |
     |      The multivariate hypergeometric distribution is a generalization
     |      of the hypergeometric distribution.
     |
     |      Choose ``nsample`` items at random without replacement from a
     |      collection with ``N`` distinct types.  ``N`` is the length of
     |      ``colors``, and the values in ``colors`` are the number of occurrences
     |      of that type in the collection.  The total number of items in the
     |      collection is ``sum(colors)``.  Each random variate generated by this
     |      function is a vector of length ``N`` holding the counts of the
     |      different types that occurred in the ``nsample`` items.
     |
     |      The name ``colors`` comes from a common description of the
     |      distribution: it is the probability distribution of the number of
     |      marbles of each color selected without replacement from an urn
     |      containing marbles of different colors; ``colors[i]`` is the number
     |      of marbles in the urn with color ``i``.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      colors : sequence of integers
     |          The number of each type of item in the collection from which
     |          a sample is drawn.  The values in ``colors`` must be nonnegative.
     |          To avoid loss of precision in the algorithm, ``sum(colors)``
     |          must be less than ``10**9`` when `method` is "marginals".
     |      nsample : int
     |          The number of items selected.  ``nsample`` must not be greater
     |          than ``sum(colors)``.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          The number of variates to generate, either an integer or a tuple
     |          holding the shape of the array of variates.  If the given size is,
     |          e.g., ``(k, m)``, then ``k * m`` variates are drawn, where one
     |          variate is a vector of length ``len(colors)``, and the return value
     |          has shape ``(k, m, len(colors))``.  If `size` is an integer, the
     |          output has shape ``(size, len(colors))``.  Default is None, in
     |          which case a single variate is returned as an array with shape
     |          ``(len(colors),)``.
     |      method : string, optional
     |          Specify the algorithm that is used to generate the variates.
     |          Must be 'count' or 'marginals' (the default).  See the Notes
     |          for a description of the methods.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      variates : ndarray
     |          Array of variates drawn from the multivariate hypergeometric
     |          distribution.
     |
     |      See Also

     |      hypergeometric : Draw samples from the (univariate) hypergeometric
     |          distribution.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The two methods do not return the same sequence of variates.
     |
     |      The "count" algorithm is roughly equivalent to the following numpy
     |      code::
     |
     |          choices = np.repeat(np.arange(len(colors)), colors)
     |          selection = np.random.choice(choices, nsample, replace=False)
     |          variate = np.bincount(selection, minlength=len(colors))
     |
     |      The "count" algorithm uses a temporary array of integers with length
     |      ``sum(colors)``.
     |
     |      The "marginals" algorithm generates a variate by using repeated
     |      calls to the univariate hypergeometric sampler.  It is roughly
     |      equivalent to::
     |
     |          variate = np.zeros(len(colors), dtype=np.int64)
     |          # `remaining` is the cumulative sum of `colors` from the last
     |          # element to the first; e.g. if `colors` is [3, 1, 5], then
     |          # `remaining` is [9, 6, 5].
     |          remaining = np.cumsum(colors[::-1])[::-1]
     |          for i in range(len(colors)-1):
     |              if nsample < 1:
     |                  break
     |              variate[i] = hypergeometric(colors[i], remaining[i+1],
     |                                         nsample)
     |              nsample -= variate[i]
     |          variate[-1] = nsample
     |
     |      The default method is "marginals".  For some cases (e.g. when
     |      `colors` contains relatively small integers), the "count" method
     |      can be significantly faster than the "marginals" method.  If
     |      performance of the algorithm is important, test the two methods
     |      with typical inputs to decide which works best.

     |
     |      Draw random samples from a multivariate normal distribution.
     |
     |      The multivariate normal, multinormal or Gaussian distribution is a
     |      generalization of the one-dimensional normal distribution to higher
     |      dimensions.  Such a distribution is specified by its mean and
     |      covariance matrix.  These parameters are analogous to the mean
     |      (average or "center") and variance (the squared standard deviation,
     |      or "width") of the one-dimensional normal distribution.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      mean : 1-D array_like, of length N
     |          Mean of the N-dimensional distribution.
     |      cov : 2-D array_like, of shape (N, N)
     |          Covariance matrix of the distribution. It must be symmetric and
     |          positive-semidefinite for proper sampling.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Given a shape of, for example, ``(m,n,k)``, ``m*n*k`` samples are
     |          generated, and packed in an `m`-by-`n`-by-`k` arrangement.  Because
     |          each sample is `N`-dimensional, the output shape is ``(m,n,k,N)``.
     |          If no shape is specified, a single (`N`-D) sample is returned.
     |      check_valid : { 'warn', 'raise', 'ignore' }, optional
     |          Behavior when the covariance matrix is not positive semidefinite.
     |      tol : float, optional
     |          Tolerance when checking the singular values in covariance matrix.
     |          cov is cast to double before the check.
     |      method : { 'svd', 'eigh', 'cholesky'}, optional
     |          The cov input is used to compute a factor matrix A such that
     |          ``A @ A.T = cov``. This argument is used to select the method
     |          used to compute the factor matrix A. The default method 'svd' is
     |          the slowest, while 'cholesky' is the fastest but less robust than
     |          the slowest method. The method `eigh` uses eigen decomposition to
     |          compute A and is faster than svd but slower than cholesky.
     |
     |          .. versionadded:: 1.18.0
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray
     |          The drawn samples, of shape *size*, if that was provided.  If not,
     |          the shape is ``(N,)``.
     |
     |          In other words, each entry ``out[i,j,...,:]`` is an N-dimensional
     |          value drawn from the distribution.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The mean is a coordinate in N-dimensional space, which represents the
     |      location where samples are most likely to be generated.  This is
     |      analogous to the peak of the bell curve for the one-dimensional or
     |      univariate normal distribution.
     |
     |      Covariance indicates the level to which two variables vary together.
     |      From the multivariate normal distribution, we draw N-dimensional
     |      samples, :math:`X = [x_1, x_2, ... x_N]`.  The covariance matrix
     |      element :math:`C_{ij}` is the covariance of :math:`x_i` and :math:`x_j`.
     |      The element :math:`C_{ii}` is the variance of :math:`x_i` (i.e. its
     |      "spread").
     |
     |      Instead of specifying the full covariance matrix, popular
     |      approximations include:
     |
     |        - Spherical covariance (`cov` is a multiple of the identity matrix)
     |        - Diagonal covariance (`cov` has non-negative elements, and only on
     |          the diagonal)
     |
     |      This geometrical property can be seen in two dimensions by plotting
     |      generated data-points:
     |
     |      >>> mean = [0, 0]
     |      >>> cov = [[1, 0], [0, 100]]  # diagonal covariance
     |
     |      Diagonal covariance means that points are oriented along x or y-axis:
     |
     |      >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
     |      >>> x, y = np.random.default_rng().multivariate_normal(mean, cov, 5000).T
     |      >>> plt.plot(x, y, 'x')
     |      >>> plt.axis('equal')
     |      >>> plt.show()
     |
     |      Note that the covariance matrix must be positive semidefinite (a.k.a.
     |      nonnegative-definite). Otherwise, the behavior of this method is
     |      undefined and backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.
     |
     |      This function internally uses linear algebra routines, and thus results
     |      may not be identical (even up to precision) across architectures, OSes,
     |      or even builds. For example, this is likely if ``cov`` has multiple equal
     |      singular values and ``method`` is ``'svd'`` (default). In this case,
     |      ``method='cholesky'`` may be more robust.

     |      We can use a different method other than the default to factorize cov:

     |      >>> y.shape

     |      Here we generate 800 samples from the bivariate normal distribution
     |      with mean [0, 0] and covariance matrix [[6, -3], [-3, 3.5]].  The
     |      expected variances of the first and second components of the sample
     |      are 6 and 3.5, respectively, and the expected correlation
     |      coefficient is -3/sqrt(6*3.5) ≈ -0.65465.
     |
     |      >>> cov = np.array([[6, -3], [-3, 3.5]])
     |      >>> pts = rng.multivariate_normal([0, 0], cov, size=800)
     |
     |      Check that the mean, covariance, and correlation coefficient of the
     |      sample are close to the expected values:
     |
     |      >>> pts.mean(axis=0)
     |      array([ 0.0326911 , -0.01280782])  # may vary

     |             [-2.85602287,  3.47613949]])  # may vary
     |      >>> np.corrcoef(pts.T)[0, 1]
     |      -0.6273591314603949  # may vary

     |  negative_binomial(...)
     |      negative_binomial(n, p, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from a negative binomial distribution.
     |
     |      Samples are drawn from a negative binomial distribution with specified
     |      parameters, `n` successes and `p` probability of success where `n`
     |      is > 0 and `p` is in the interval (0, 1].
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      n : float or array_like of floats
     |          Parameter of the distribution, > 0.
     |      p : float or array_like of floats
     |          Parameter of the distribution. Must satisfy 0 < p <= 1.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``n`` and ``p`` are both scalars.
     |          Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(n, p).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized negative binomial distribution,
     |          where each sample is equal to N, the number of failures that
     |          occurred before a total of n successes was reached.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability mass function of the negative binomial distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: P(N;n,p) = \frac{\Gamma(N+n)}{N!\Gamma(n)}p^{n}(1-p)^{N},
     |
     |      where :math:`n` is the number of successes, :math:`p` is the
     |      probability of success, :math:`N+n` is the number of trials, and
     |      :math:`\Gamma` is the gamma function. When :math:`n` is an integer,
     |      :math:`\frac{\Gamma(N+n)}{N!\Gamma(n)} = \binom{N+n-1}{N}`, which is
     |      the more common form of this term in the pmf. The negative
     |      binomial distribution gives the probability of N failures given n
     |      successes, with a success on the last trial.
     |
     |      If one throws a die repeatedly until the third time a "1" appears,
     |      then the probability distribution of the number of non-"1"s that
     |      appear before the third "1" is a negative binomial distribution.
     |
     |      Because this method internally calls ``Generator.poisson`` with an
     |      intermediate random value, a ValueError is raised when the choice of
     |      :math:`n` and :math:`p` would result in the mean + 10 sigma of the sampled
     |      intermediate distribution exceeding the max acceptable value of the
     |      ``Generator.poisson`` method. This happens when :math:`p` is too low
     |      (a lot of failures happen for every success) and :math:`n` is too big (
     |      a lot of successes are allowed).
     |      Therefore, the :math:`n` and :math:`p` values must satisfy the constraint:
     |
     |      .. math:: n\frac{1-p}{p}+10n\sqrt{n}\frac{1-p}{p}<2^{63}-1-10\sqrt{2^{63}-1},
     |
     |      Where the left side of the equation is the derived mean + 10 sigma of
     |      a sample from the gamma distribution internally used as the :math:`lam`
     |      parameter of a poisson sample, and the right side of the equation is
     |      the constraint for maximum value of :math:`lam` in ``Generator.poisson``.

     |
     |      Samples are drawn from an F distribution with specified parameters,
     |      `dfnum` (degrees of freedom in numerator) and `dfden` (degrees of
     |      freedom in denominator), where both parameters > 1.
     |      `nonc` is the non-centrality parameter.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      dfnum : float or array_like of floats
     |          Numerator degrees of freedom, must be > 0.

     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      When calculating the power of an experiment (power = probability of
     |      rejecting the null hypothesis when a specific alternative is true) the
     |      non-central F statistic becomes important.  When the null hypothesis is
     |      true, the F statistic follows a central F distribution. When the null
     |      hypothesis is not true, then it follows a non-central F statistic.

     |  normal(...)
     |      normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw random samples from a normal (Gaussian) distribution.
     |
     |      The probability density function of the normal distribution, first
     |      derived by De Moivre and 200 years later by both Gauss and Laplace
     |      independently [2]_, is often called the bell curve because of
     |      its characteristic shape (see the example below).
     |
     |      The normal distributions occurs often in nature.  For example, it
     |      describes the commonly occurring distribution of samples influenced
     |      by a large number of tiny, random disturbances, each with its own
     |      unique distribution [2]_.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      loc : float or array_like of floats
     |          Mean ("centre") of the distribution.
     |      scale : float or array_like of floats
     |          Standard deviation (spread or "width") of the distribution. Must be
     |          non-negative.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``loc`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
     |          Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(loc, scale).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized normal distribution.

     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density for the Gaussian distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: p(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 \pi \sigma^2 }}
     |                       e^{ - \frac{ (x - \mu)^2 } {2 \sigma^2} },
     |
     |      where :math:`\mu` is the mean and :math:`\sigma` the standard
     |      deviation. The square of the standard deviation, :math:`\sigma^2`,
     |      is called the variance.
     |
     |      The function has its peak at the mean, and its "spread" increases with
     |      the standard deviation (the function reaches 0.607 times its maximum at
     |      :math:`x + \sigma` and :math:`x - \sigma` [2]_).  This implies that
     |      :meth:`normal` is more likely to return samples lying close to the
     |      mean, rather than those far away.

     |
     |  pareto(...)
     |      pareto(a, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from a Pareto II or Lomax distribution with
     |      specified shape.
     |
     |      The Lomax or Pareto II distribution is a shifted Pareto
     |      distribution. The classical Pareto distribution can be
     |      obtained from the Lomax distribution by adding 1 and
     |      multiplying by the scale parameter ``m`` (see Notes).  The
     |      smallest value of the Lomax distribution is zero while for the
     |      classical Pareto distribution it is ``mu``, where the standard
     |      Pareto distribution has location ``mu = 1``.  Lomax can also
     |      be considered as a simplified version of the Generalized
     |      Pareto distribution (available in SciPy), with the scale set
     |      to one and the location set to zero.
     |
     |      The Pareto distribution must be greater than zero, and is
     |      unbounded above.  It is also known as the "80-20 rule".  In
     |      this distribution, 80 percent of the weights are in the lowest
     |      20 percent of the range, while the other 20 percent fill the
     |      remaining 80 percent of the range.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      a : float or array_like of floats
     |          Shape of the distribution. Must be positive.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``a`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
     |          ``np.array(a).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized Pareto distribution.

     |      The probability density for the Pareto distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: p(x) = \frac{am^a}{x^{a+1}}
     |
     |      where :math:`a` is the shape and :math:`m` the scale.
     |
     |      The Pareto distribution, named after the Italian economist
     |      Vilfredo Pareto, is a power law probability distribution
     |      useful in many real world problems.  Outside the field of
     |      economics it is generally referred to as the Bradford
     |      distribution. Pareto developed the distribution to describe
     |      the distribution of wealth in an economy.  It has also found
     |      use in insurance, web page access statistics, oil field sizes,
     |      and many other problems, including the download frequency for
     |      projects in Sourceforge [1]_.  It is one of the so-called
     |      "fat-tailed" distributions.

     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      Draw samples from the distribution:
     |
     |      >>> a, m = 3., 2.  # shape and mode
     |      >>> s = (np.random.default_rng().pareto(a, 1000) + 1) * m

     |
     |  permutation(...)
     |      permutation(x, axis=0)
     |
     |      Randomly permute a sequence, or return a permuted range.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      x : int or array_like
     |          If `x` is an integer, randomly permute ``np.arange(x)``.
     |          If `x` is an array, make a copy and shuffle the elements
     |          randomly.
     |      axis : int, optional
     |          The axis which `x` is shuffled along. Default is 0.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray
     |          Permuted sequence or array range.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
     |      >>> rng.permutation(10)
     |      array([1, 7, 4, 3, 0, 9, 2, 5, 8, 6]) # random

     |             [0, 1, 2],
     |             [3, 4, 5]])
     |
     |      >>> rng.permutation("abc")
     |      Traceback (most recent call last):
     |          ...

     |
     |      >>> arr = np.arange(9).reshape((3, 3))
     |      >>> rng.permutation(arr, axis=1)
     |      array([[0, 2, 1], # random
     |             [3, 5, 4],
     |             [6, 8, 7]])
     |
     |  permuted(...)
     |      permuted(x, axis=None, out=None)
     |
     |      Randomly permute `x` along axis `axis`.
     |
     |      Unlike `shuffle`, each slice along the given axis is shuffled
     |      independently of the others.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      x : array_like, at least one-dimensional
     |          Array to be shuffled.
     |      axis : int, optional
     |          Slices of `x` in this axis are shuffled. Each slice
     |          is shuffled independently of the others.  If `axis` is
     |          None, the flattened array is shuffled.
     |      out : ndarray, optional
     |          If given, this is the destination of the shuffled array.
     |          If `out` is None, a shuffled copy of the array is returned.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      ndarray
     |          If `out` is None, a shuffled copy of `x` is returned.
     |          Otherwise, the shuffled array is stored in `out`,
     |          and `out` is returned
     |

     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      An important distinction between methods ``shuffle``  and ``permuted`` is
     |      how they both treat the ``axis`` parameter which can be found at
     |      :ref:`generator-handling-axis-parameter`.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      Create a `numpy.random.Generator` instance:
     |
     |      >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
     |
     |      Create a test array:
     |
     |      >>> x = np.arange(24).reshape(3, 8)
     |      >>> x
     |      array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7],
     |             [ 8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
     |             [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]])
     |
     |      Shuffle the rows of `x`:
     |
     |      >>> y = rng.permuted(x, axis=1)
     |      >>> y
     |      array([[ 4,  3,  6,  7,  1,  2,  5,  0],  # random
     |             [15, 10, 14,  9, 12, 11,  8, 13],
     |             [17, 16, 20, 21, 18, 22, 23, 19]])
     |
     |      `x` has not been modified:
     |
     |      >>> x
     |      array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7],
     |             [ 8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
     |             [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]])
     |
     |      To shuffle the rows of `x` in-place, pass `x` as the `out`
     |      parameter:
     |
     |      >>> y = rng.permuted(x, axis=1, out=x)
     |      >>> x
     |      array([[ 3,  0,  4,  7,  1,  6,  2,  5],  # random
     |             [ 8, 14, 13,  9, 12, 11, 15, 10],
     |             [17, 18, 16, 22, 19, 23, 20, 21]])
     |
     |      Note that when the ``out`` parameter is given, the return
     |      value is ``out``:
     |
     |      >>> y is x
     |      True
     |
     |  poisson(...)
     |      poisson(lam=1.0, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from a Poisson distribution.
     |
     |      The Poisson distribution is the limit of the binomial distribution
     |      for large N.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      lam : float or array_like of floats
     |          Expected number of events occurring in a fixed-time interval,
     |          must be >= 0. A sequence must be broadcastable over the requested
     |          size.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``lam`` is a scalar. Otherwise,
     |          ``np.array(lam).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized Poisson distribution.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The Poisson distribution
     |
     |      .. math:: f(k; \lambda)=\frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
     |
     |      For events with an expected separation :math:`\lambda` the Poisson
     |      distribution :math:`f(k; \lambda)` describes the probability of
     |      :math:`k` events occurring within the observed
     |      interval :math:`\lambda`.
     |
     |      Because the output is limited to the range of the C int64 type, a
     |      ValueError is raised when `lam` is within 10 sigma of the maximum
     |      representable value.

     |      >>> s = rng.poisson(lam=(100., 500.), size=(100, 2))
     |
     |  power(...)
     |      power(a, size=None)
     |
     |      Draws samples in [0, 1] from a power distribution with positive
     |      exponent a - 1.
     |
     |      Also known as the power function distribution.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      a : float or array_like of floats
     |          Parameter of the distribution. Must be non-negative.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``a`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
     |          ``np.array(a).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized power distribution.
     |
     |      Raises
     |      ------
     |      ValueError
     |          If a <= 0.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density function is
     |
     |      .. math:: P(x; a) = ax^{a-1}, 0 \le x \le 1, a>0.
     |
     |      The power function distribution is just the inverse of the Pareto
     |      distribution. It may also be seen as a special case of the Beta
     |      distribution.
     |
     |      It is used, for example, in modeling the over-reporting of insurance
     |      claims.

     |
     |      Return random floats in the half-open interval [0.0, 1.0).
     |
     |      Results are from the "continuous uniform" distribution over the
     |      stated interval.  To sample :math:`Unif[a, b), b > a` use `uniform`
     |      or multiply the output of `random` by ``(b - a)`` and add ``a``::
     |
     |          (b - a) * random() + a
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
     |          single value is returned.
     |      dtype : dtype, optional
     |          Desired dtype of the result, only `float64` and `float32` are supported.
     |          Byteorder must be native. The default value is np.float64.
     |      out : ndarray, optional
     |          Alternative output array in which to place the result. If size is not None,
     |          it must have the same shape as the provided size and must match the type of
     |          the output values.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : float or ndarray of floats
     |          Array of random floats of shape `size` (unless ``size=None``, in which
     |          case a single float is returned).

     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``scale`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
     |          ``np.array(scale).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized Rayleigh distribution.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density function for the Rayleigh distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: P(x;scale) = \frac{x}{scale^2}e^{\frac{-x^2}{2 \cdotp scale^2}}
     |
     |      The Rayleigh distribution would arise, for example, if the East
     |      and North components of the wind velocity had identical zero-mean
     |      Gaussian distributions.  Then the wind speed would have a Rayleigh
     |      distribution.

     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      Draw values from the distribution and plot the histogram
     |
     |      >>> from matplotlib.pyplot import hist
     |      >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
     |      >>> values = hist(rng.rayleigh(3, 100000), bins=200, density=True)
     |
     |      Wave heights tend to follow a Rayleigh distribution. If the mean wave
     |      height is 1 meter, what fraction of waves are likely to be larger than 3
     |      meters?
     |
     |      >>> meanvalue = 1
     |      >>> modevalue = np.sqrt(2 / np.pi) * meanvalue
     |      >>> s = rng.rayleigh(modevalue, 1000000)
     |
     |      The percentage of waves larger than 3 meters is:
     |
     |      >>> 100.*sum(s>3)/1000000.

     |  shuffle(...)
     |      shuffle(x, axis=0)
     |
     |      Modify an array or sequence in-place by shuffling its contents.
     |
     |      The order of sub-arrays is changed but their contents remains the same.

     |      Parameters
     |      ----------

     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      An important distinction between methods ``shuffle``  and ``permuted`` is
     |      how they both treat the ``axis`` parameter which can be found at
     |      :ref:`generator-handling-axis-parameter`.

     |  spawn(...)
     |      spawn(n_children)
     |
     |      Create new independent child generators.

     |      children.
     |
     |      .. versionadded:: 1.25.0
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      n_children : int
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      child_generators : list of Generators
     |
     |      Raises
     |      ------
     |      TypeError
     |          When the underlying SeedSequence does not implement spawning.
     |
     |      See Also
     |      --------
     |      random.BitGenerator.spawn, random.SeedSequence.spawn :
     |          Equivalent method on the bit generator and seed sequence.
     |      bit_generator :
     |          The bit generator instance used by the generator.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      Starting from a seeded default generator:
     |
     |      >>> # High quality entropy created with: f"0x{secrets.randbits(128):x}"
     |      >>> entropy = 0x3034c61a9ae04ff8cb62ab8ec2c4b501
     |      >>> rng = np.random.default_rng(entropy)
     |
     |      Create two new generators for example for parallel execution:
     |
     |      >>> child_rng1, child_rng2 = rng.spawn(2)
     |
     |      Drawn numbers from each are independent but derived from the initial
     |      seeding entropy:
     |
     |      >>> rng.uniform(), child_rng1.uniform(), child_rng2.uniform()
     |      (0.19029263503854454, 0.9475673279178444, 0.4702687338396767)
     |
     |      It is safe to spawn additional children from the original ``rng`` or
     |      the children:
     |
     |      >>> more_child_rngs = rng.spawn(20)
     |      >>> nested_spawn = child_rng1.spawn(20)
     |
     |  standard_cauchy(...)
     |      standard_cauchy(size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from a standard Cauchy distribution with mode = 0.
     |
     |      Also known as the Lorentz distribution.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
     |          single value is returned.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      samples : ndarray or scalar
     |          The drawn samples.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density function for the full Cauchy distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: P(x; x_0, \gamma) = \frac{1}{\pi \gamma \bigl[ 1+
     |                (\frac{x-x_0}{\gamma})^2 \bigr] }
     |
     |      and the Standard Cauchy distribution just sets :math:`x_0=0` and
     |      :math:`\gamma=1`
     |
     |      The Cauchy distribution arises in the solution to the driven harmonic
     |      oscillator problem, and also describes spectral line broadening. It
     |      also describes the distribution of values at which a line tilted at
     |      a random angle will cut the x axis.
     |
     |      When studying hypothesis tests that assume normality, seeing how the
     |      tests perform on data from a Cauchy distribution is a good indicator of
     |      their sensitivity to a heavy-tailed distribution, since the Cauchy looks
     |      very much like a Gaussian distribution, but with heavier tails.

     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional

     |      out : ndarray, optional
     |          Alternative output array in which to place the result. If size is not None,
     |          it must have the same shape as the provided size and must match the type of

     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : float or ndarray
     |          Drawn samples.
     |
     |      Examples

     |      >>> n = np.random.default_rng().standard_exponential((3, 8000))
     |
     |  standard_gamma(...)
     |      standard_gamma(shape, size=None, dtype=np.float64, out=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from a standard Gamma distribution.
     |
     |      Samples are drawn from a Gamma distribution with specified parameters,
     |      shape (sometimes designated "k") and scale=1.
     |
     |      Parameters

     |      shape : float or array_like of floats
     |          Parameter, must be non-negative.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``shape`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
     |          ``np.array(shape).size`` samples are drawn.
     |      dtype : dtype, optional
     |          Desired dtype of the result, only `float64` and `float32` are supported.
     |          Byteorder must be native. The default value is np.float64.
     |      out : ndarray, optional

     |          not None, it must have the same shape as the provided size and
     |          must match the type of the output values.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized standard gamma distribution.

     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density for the Gamma distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: p(x) = x^{k-1}\frac{e^{-x/\theta}}{\theta^k\Gamma(k)},
     |
     |      where :math:`k` is the shape and :math:`\theta` the scale,
     |      and :math:`\Gamma` is the Gamma function.
     |
     |      The Gamma distribution is often used to model the times to failure of
     |      electronic components, and arises naturally in processes for which the
     |      waiting times between Poisson distributed events are relevant.

     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``df`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
     |          ``np.array(df).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized standard Student's t distribution.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density function for the t distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: P(x, df) = \frac{\Gamma(\frac{df+1}{2})}{\sqrt{\pi df}
     |                \Gamma(\frac{df}{2})}\Bigl( 1+\frac{x^2}{df} \Bigr)^{-(df+1)/2}
     |
     |      The t test is based on an assumption that the data come from a
     |      Normal distribution. The t test provides a way to test whether
     |      the sample mean (that is the mean calculated from the data) is
     |      a good estimate of the true mean.
     |
     |      The derivation of the t-distribution was first published in
     |      1908 by William Gosset while working for the Guinness Brewery
     |      in Dublin. Due to proprietary issues, he had to publish under
     |      a pseudonym, and so he used the name Student.

     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      From Dalgaard page 83 [1]_, suppose the daily energy intake for 11
     |      women in kilojoules (kJ) is:
     |
     |      >>> intake = np.array([5260., 5470, 5640, 6180, 6390, 6515, 6805, 7515, \
     |      ...                    7515, 8230, 8770])
     |
     |      Does their energy intake deviate systematically from the recommended
     |      value of 7725 kJ? Our null hypothesis will be the absence of deviation,
     |      and the alternate hypothesis will be the presence of an effect that could be
     |      either positive or negative, hence making our test 2-tailed.
     |
     |      Because we are estimating the mean and we have N=11 values in our sample,
     |      we have N-1=10 degrees of freedom. We set our significance level to 95% and
     |      compute the t statistic using the empirical mean and empirical standard
     |      deviation of our intake. We use a ddof of 1 to base the computation of our
     |      empirical standard deviation on an unbiased estimate of the variance (note:
     |      the final estimate is not unbiased due to the concave nature of the square
     |      root).
     |
     |      >>> np.mean(intake)
     |      6753.636363636364
     |      >>> intake.std(ddof=1)
     |      1142.1232221373727
     |      >>> t = (np.mean(intake)-7725)/(intake.std(ddof=1)/np.sqrt(len(intake)))
     |      >>> t
     |      -2.8207540608310198
     |
     |      We draw 1000000 samples from Student's t distribution with the adequate
     |      degrees of freedom.
     |
     |      >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
     |      >>> s = np.random.default_rng().standard_t(10, size=1000000)
     |      >>> h = plt.hist(s, bins=100, density=True)
     |
     |      Does our t statistic land in one of the two critical regions found at
     |      both tails of the distribution?
     |
     |      >>> np.sum(np.abs(t) < np.abs(s)) / float(len(s))
     |      0.018318  #random < 0.05, statistic is in critical region
     |
     |      The probability value for this 2-tailed test is about 1.83%, which is
     |      lower than the 5% pre-determined significance threshold.
     |
     |      Therefore, the probability of observing values as extreme as our intake
     |      conditionally on the null hypothesis being true is too low, and we reject
     |      the null hypothesis of no deviation.

     |  triangular(...)
     |      triangular(left, mode, right, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from the triangular distribution over the
     |      interval ``[left, right]``.
     |
     |      The triangular distribution is a continuous probability
     |      distribution with lower limit left, peak at mode, and upper
     |      limit right. Unlike the other distributions, these parameters
     |      directly define the shape of the pdf.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      left : float or array_like of floats
     |          Lower limit.
     |      mode : float or array_like of floats
     |          The value where the peak of the distribution occurs.
     |          The value must fulfill the condition ``left <= mode <= right``.
     |      right : float or array_like of floats
     |          Upper limit, must be larger than `left`.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``left``, ``mode``, and ``right``
     |          are all scalars.  Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(left, mode, right).size``
     |          samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized triangular distribution.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density function for the triangular distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: P(x;l, m, r) = \begin{cases}
     |                \frac{2(x-l)}{(r-l)(m-l)}& \text{for $l \leq x \leq m$},\\
     |                \frac{2(r-x)}{(r-l)(r-m)}& \text{for $m \leq x \leq r$},\\
     |                0& \text{otherwise}.
     |                \end{cases}
     |
     |      The triangular distribution is often used in ill-defined
     |      problems where the underlying distribution is not known, but
     |      some knowledge of the limits and mode exists. Often it is used
     |      in simulations.

     |      >>> plt.show()
     |
     |  uniform(...)
     |      uniform(low=0.0, high=1.0, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from a uniform distribution.
     |
     |      Samples are uniformly distributed over the half-open interval
     |      ``[low, high)`` (includes low, but excludes high).  In other words,
     |      any value within the given interval is equally likely to be drawn
     |      by `uniform`.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      low : float or array_like of floats, optional
     |          Lower boundary of the output interval.  All values generated will be
     |          greater than or equal to low.  The default value is 0.
     |      high : float or array_like of floats
     |          Upper boundary of the output interval.  All values generated will be
     |          less than high.  The high limit may be included in the returned array of
     |          floats due to floating-point rounding in the equation
     |          ``low + (high-low) * random_sample()``.  high - low must be
     |          non-negative.  The default value is 1.0.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``low`` and ``high`` are both scalars.
     |          Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(low, high).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------

     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density function of the uniform distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: p(x) = \frac{1}{b - a}
     |
     |      anywhere within the interval ``[a, b)``, and zero elsewhere.
     |
     |      When ``high`` == ``low``, values of ``low`` will be returned.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      Draw samples from the distribution:
     |
     |      >>> s = np.random.default_rng().uniform(-1,0,1000)
     |
     |      All values are within the given interval:

     |      >>> np.all(s >= -1)
     |      True

     |
     |  vonmises(...)
     |      vonmises(mu, kappa, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from a von Mises distribution.
     |
     |      Samples are drawn from a von Mises distribution with specified mode
     |      (mu) and dispersion (kappa), on the interval [-pi, pi].
     |
     |      The von Mises distribution (also known as the circular normal
     |      distribution) is a continuous probability distribution on the unit
     |      circle.  It may be thought of as the circular analogue of the normal
     |      distribution.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      mu : float or array_like of floats
     |          Mode ("center") of the distribution.
     |      kappa : float or array_like of floats
     |          Dispersion of the distribution, has to be >=0.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``mu`` and ``kappa`` are both scalars.
     |          Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(mu, kappa).size`` samples are drawn.

     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density for the von Mises distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: p(x) = \frac{e^{\kappa cos(x-\mu)}}{2\pi I_0(\kappa)},
     |
     |      where :math:`\mu` is the mode and :math:`\kappa` the dispersion,
     |      and :math:`I_0(\kappa)` is the modified Bessel function of order 0.
     |
     |      The von Mises is named for Richard Edler von Mises, who was born in
     |      Austria-Hungary, in what is now the Ukraine.  He fled to the United
     |      States in 1939 and became a professor at Harvard.  He worked in
     |      probability theory, aerodynamics, fluid mechanics, and philosophy of

     |
     |  wald(...)
     |      wald(mean, scale, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from a Wald, or inverse Gaussian, distribution.
     |
     |      As the scale approaches infinity, the distribution becomes more like a
     |      Gaussian. Some references claim that the Wald is an inverse Gaussian
     |      with mean equal to 1, but this is by no means universal.
     |
     |      The inverse Gaussian distribution was first studied in relationship to
     |      Brownian motion. In 1956 M.C.K. Tweedie used the name inverse Gaussian
     |      because there is an inverse relationship between the time to cover a
     |      unit distance and distance covered in unit time.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      mean : float or array_like of floats
     |          Distribution mean, must be > 0.
     |      scale : float or array_like of floats
     |          Scale parameter, must be > 0.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``mean`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
     |          Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(mean, scale).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized Wald distribution.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density function for the Wald distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: P(x;mean,scale) = \sqrt{\frac{scale}{2\pi x^3}}e^
     |                                  \frac{-scale(x-mean)^2}{2\cdotp mean^2x}
     |
     |      As noted above the inverse Gaussian distribution first arise
     |      from attempts to model Brownian motion. It is also a
     |      competitor to the Weibull for use in reliability modeling and
     |      modeling stock returns and interest rate processes.

     |      The probability density for the Weibull distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: p(x) = \frac{a}
     |                       {\lambda}(\frac{x}{\lambda})^{a-1}e^{-(x/\lambda)^a},
     |
     |      where :math:`a` is the shape and :math:`\lambda` the scale.
     |
     |      The function has its peak (the mode) at
     |      :math:`\lambda(\frac{a-1}{a})^{1/a}`.
     |
     |      When ``a = 1``, the Weibull distribution reduces to the exponential
     |      distribution.

     |      Draw samples from the distribution:
     |
     |      >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
     |      >>> a = 5. # shape

     |  zipf(...)
     |      zipf(a, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from a Zipf distribution.
     |
     |      Samples are drawn from a Zipf distribution with specified parameter
     |      `a` > 1.
     |
     |      The Zipf distribution (also known as the zeta distribution) is a
     |      discrete probability distribution that satisfies Zipf's law: the
     |      frequency of an item is inversely proportional to its rank in a
     |      frequency table.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      a : float or array_like of floats
     |          Distribution parameter. Must be greater than 1.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``a`` is a scalar. Otherwise,
     |          ``np.array(a).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized Zipf distribution.

     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density for the Zipf distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: p(k) = \frac{k^{-a}}{\zeta(a)},
     |
     |      for integers :math:`k \geq 1`, where :math:`\zeta` is the Riemann Zeta
     |      function.
     |
     |      It is named for the American linguist George Kingsley Zipf, who noted
     |      that the frequency of any word in a sample of a language is inversely
     |      proportional to its rank in the frequency table.

     |      Gets the bit generator instance used by the generator
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      bit_generator : BitGenerator
     |          The bit generator instance used by the generator

    class MT19937(numpy.random.bit_generator.BitGenerator)
     |  MT19937(seed=None)
     |
     |  Container for the Mersenne Twister pseudo-random number generator.
     |
     |  Parameters
     |  ----------
     |  seed : {None, int, array_like[ints], SeedSequence}, optional
     |      A seed to initialize the `BitGenerator`. If None, then fresh,
     |      unpredictable entropy will be pulled from the OS. If an ``int`` or
     |      ``array_like[ints]`` is passed, then it will be passed to
     |      `SeedSequence` to derive the initial `BitGenerator` state. One may also
     |      pass in a `SeedSequence` instance.
     |
     |  Attributes
     |  ----------
     |  lock: threading.Lock
     |      Lock instance that is shared so that the same bit git generator can
     |      be used in multiple Generators without corrupting the state. Code that
     |      generates values from a bit generator should hold the bit generator's
     |      lock.
     |
     |  Notes
     |  -----
     |  ``MT19937`` provides a capsule containing function pointers that produce
     |  doubles, and unsigned 32 and 64- bit integers [1]_. These are not
     |  directly consumable in Python and must be consumed by a ``Generator``
     |  or similar object that supports low-level access.
     |
     |  The Python stdlib module "random" also contains a Mersenne Twister
     |  pseudo-random number generator.
     |
     |  **State and Seeding**
     |
     |  The ``MT19937`` state vector consists of a 624-element array of
     |  32-bit unsigned integers plus a single integer value between 0 and 624
     |  that indexes the current position within the main array.
     |
     |  The input seed is processed by `SeedSequence` to fill the whole state. The
     |  first element is reset such that only its most significant bit is set.
     |
     |  **Parallel Features**
     |
     |  The preferred way to use a BitGenerator in parallel applications is to use
     |  the `SeedSequence.spawn` method to obtain entropy values, and to use these
     |  to generate new BitGenerators:
     |
     |  >>> from numpy.random import Generator, MT19937, SeedSequence
     |  >>> sg = SeedSequence(1234)
     |  >>> rg = [Generator(MT19937(s)) for s in sg.spawn(10)]
     |
     |  Another method is to use `MT19937.jumped` which advances the state as-if
     |  :math:`2^{128}` random numbers have been generated ([1]_, [2]_). This
     |  allows the original sequence to be split so that distinct segments can be
     |  used in each worker process. All generators should be chained to ensure
     |  that the segments come from the same sequence.
     |
     |  >>> from numpy.random import Generator, MT19937, SeedSequence
     |  >>> sg = SeedSequence(1234)
     |  >>> bit_generator = MT19937(sg)
     |  >>> rg = []
     |  >>> for _ in range(10):
     |  ...    rg.append(Generator(bit_generator))
     |  ...    # Chain the BitGenerators
     |  ...    bit_generator = bit_generator.jumped()
     |
     |  **Compatibility Guarantee**
     |
     |  ``MT19937`` makes a guarantee that a fixed seed will always produce
     |  the same random integer stream.

     |      Returns a new bit generator with the state jumped
     |
     |      The state of the returned bit generator is jumped as-if
     |      2**(128 * jumps) random numbers have been generated.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      jumps : integer, positive
     |          Number of times to jump the state of the bit generator returned
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      bit_generator : MT19937

     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The jump step is computed using a modified version of Matsumoto's
     |      implementation of Horner's method. The step polynomial is precomputed
     |      to perform 2**128 steps. The jumped state has been verified to match
     |      the state produced using Matsumoto's original code.

     |
     |  Notes
     |  -----
     |  PCG-64 is a 128-bit implementation of O'Neill's permutation congruential
     |  generator ([1]_, [2]_). PCG-64 has a period of :math:`2^{128}` and supports
     |  advancing an arbitrary number of steps as well as :math:`2^{127}` streams.
     |  The specific member of the PCG family that we use is PCG XSL RR 128/64
     |  as described in the paper ([2]_).
     |
     |  ``PCG64`` provides a capsule containing function pointers that produce
     |  doubles, and unsigned 32 and 64- bit integers. These are not
     |  directly consumable in Python and must be consumed by a ``Generator``
     |  or similar object that supports low-level access.
     |
     |  Supports the method :meth:`advance` to advance the RNG an arbitrary number of
     |  steps. The state of the PCG-64 RNG is represented by 2 128-bit unsigned
     |  integers.
     |
     |  **State and Seeding**
     |
     |  The ``PCG64`` state vector consists of 2 unsigned 128-bit values,
     |  which are represented externally as Python ints. One is the state of the
     |  PRNG, which is advanced by a linear congruential generator (LCG). The
     |  second is a fixed odd increment used in the LCG.
     |
     |  The input seed is processed by `SeedSequence` to generate both values. The
     |  increment is not independently settable.
     |
     |  **Parallel Features**
     |
     |  The preferred way to use a BitGenerator in parallel applications is to use
     |  the `SeedSequence.spawn` method to obtain entropy values, and to use these

     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      delta : integer, positive
     |          Number of draws to advance the RNG. Must be less than the

     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      Advancing a RNG updates the underlying RNG state as-if a given
     |      number of calls to the underlying RNG have been made. In general
     |      there is not a one-to-one relationship between the number output
     |      random values from a particular distribution and the number of
     |      draws from the core RNG.  This occurs for two reasons:
     |
     |      * The random values are simulated using a rejection-based method
     |        and so, on average, more than one value from the underlying
     |        RNG is required to generate an single draw.
     |      * The number of bits required to generate a simulated value
     |        differs from the number of bits generated by the underlying
     |        RNG.  For example, two 16-bit integer values can be simulated
     |        from a single draw of a 32-bit RNG.
     |
     |      Advancing the RNG state resets any pre-computed random numbers.
     |      This is required to ensure exact reproducibility.

     |  Parameters
     |  ----------
     |  seed : {None, int, array_like[ints], SeedSequence}, optional
     |      A seed to initialize the `BitGenerator`. If None, then fresh,
     |      unpredictable entropy will be pulled from the OS. If an ``int`` or
     |      ``array_like[ints]`` is passed, then it will be passed to
     |      `SeedSequence` to derive the initial `BitGenerator` state. One may also
     |      pass in a `SeedSequence` instance.
     |
     |  Notes
     |  -----
     |  PCG-64 DXSM is a 128-bit implementation of O'Neill's permutation congruential
     |  generator ([1]_, [2]_). PCG-64 DXSM has a period of :math:`2^{128}` and supports
     |  advancing an arbitrary number of steps as well as :math:`2^{127}` streams.
     |  The specific member of the PCG family that we use is PCG CM DXSM 128/64. It
     |  differs from ``PCG64`` in that it uses the stronger DXSM output function,
     |  a 64-bit "cheap multiplier" in the LCG, and outputs from the state before
     |  advancing it rather than advance-then-output.
     |
     |  ``PCG64DXSM`` provides a capsule containing function pointers that produce
     |  doubles, and unsigned 32 and 64- bit integers. These are not
     |  directly consumable in Python and must be consumed by a ``Generator``
     |  or similar object that supports low-level access.
     |
     |  Supports the method :meth:`advance` to advance the RNG an arbitrary number of
     |  steps. The state of the PCG-64 DXSM RNG is represented by 2 128-bit unsigned
     |  integers.
     |
     |  **State and Seeding**
     |
     |  The ``PCG64DXSM`` state vector consists of 2 unsigned 128-bit values,
     |  which are represented externally as Python ints. One is the state of the
     |  PRNG, which is advanced by a linear congruential generator (LCG). The
     |  second is a fixed odd increment used in the LCG.
     |
     |  The input seed is processed by `SeedSequence` to generate both values. The
     |  increment is not independently settable.
     |
     |  **Parallel Features**
     |
     |  The preferred way to use a BitGenerator in parallel applications is to use
     |  the `SeedSequence.spawn` method to obtain entropy values, and to use these
     |  to generate new BitGenerators:
     |
     |  >>> from numpy.random import Generator, PCG64DXSM, SeedSequence
     |  >>> sg = SeedSequence(1234)
     |  >>> rg = [Generator(PCG64DXSM(s)) for s in sg.spawn(10)]
     |
     |  **Compatibility Guarantee**
     |
     |  ``PCG64DXSM`` makes a guarantee that a fixed seed will always produce
     |  the same random integer stream.

     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      seed_seq : ISeedSequence
     |          The SeedSequence object used to initialize the BitGenerator.
     |          This is normally a `np.random.SeedSequence` instance.

    class Philox(numpy.random.bit_generator.BitGenerator)
     |  Philox(seed=None, counter=None, key=None)
     |
     |  Container for the Philox (4x64) pseudo-random number generator.
     |
     |  Parameters
     |  ----------
     |  seed : {None, int, array_like[ints], SeedSequence}, optional
     |      A seed to initialize the `BitGenerator`. If None, then fresh,
     |      unpredictable entropy will be pulled from the OS. If an ``int`` or
     |      ``array_like[ints]`` is passed, then it will be passed to
     |      `SeedSequence` to derive the initial `BitGenerator` state. One may also
     |      pass in a `SeedSequence` instance.
     |  counter : {None, int, array_like}, optional
     |      Counter to use in the Philox state. Can be either
     |      a Python int (long in 2.x) in [0, 2**256) or a 4-element uint64 array.
     |      If not provided, the RNG is initialized at 0.
     |  key : {None, int, array_like}, optional
     |      Key to use in the Philox state.  Unlike ``seed``, the value in key is
     |      directly set. Can be either a Python int in [0, 2**128) or a 2-element
     |      uint64 array. `key` and ``seed`` cannot both be used.
     |
     |  Attributes
     |  ----------
     |  lock: threading.Lock
     |      Lock instance that is shared so that the same bit git generator can
     |      be used in multiple Generators without corrupting the state. Code that
     |      generates values from a bit generator should hold the bit generator's
     |      lock.
     |
     |  Notes
     |  -----
     |  Philox is a 64-bit PRNG that uses a counter-based design based on weaker
     |  (and faster) versions of cryptographic functions [1]_. Instances using
     |  different values of the key produce independent sequences.  Philox has a
     |  period of :math:`2^{256} - 1` and supports arbitrary advancing and jumping
     |  the sequence in increments of :math:`2^{128}`. These features allow
     |  multiple non-overlapping sequences to be generated.
     |
     |  ``Philox`` provides a capsule containing function pointers that produce
     |  doubles, and unsigned 32 and 64- bit integers. These are not
     |  directly consumable in Python and must be consumed by a ``Generator``
     |  or similar object that supports low-level access.
     |
     |  **State and Seeding**
     |
     |  The ``Philox`` state vector consists of a 256-bit value encoded as
     |  a 4-element uint64 array and a 128-bit value encoded as a 2-element uint64
     |  array. The former is a counter which is incremented by 1 for every 4 64-bit
     |  randoms produced. The second is a key which determined the sequence
     |  produced. Using different keys produces independent sequences.
     |
     |  The input ``seed`` is processed by `SeedSequence` to generate the key. The
     |  counter is set to 0.
     |
     |  Alternately, one can omit the ``seed`` parameter and set the ``key`` and
     |  ``counter`` directly.
     |
     |  **Parallel Features**
     |
     |  The preferred way to use a BitGenerator in parallel applications is to use
     |  the `SeedSequence.spawn` method to obtain entropy values, and to use these
     |  to generate new BitGenerators:
     |
     |  >>> from numpy.random import Generator, Philox, SeedSequence
     |  >>> sg = SeedSequence(1234)
     |  >>> rg = [Generator(Philox(s)) for s in sg.spawn(10)]
     |
     |  ``Philox`` can be used in parallel applications by calling the ``jumped``
     |  method  to advances the state as-if :math:`2^{128}` random numbers have
     |  been generated. Alternatively, ``advance`` can be used to advance the
     |  counter for any positive step in [0, 2**256). When using ``jumped``, all
     |  generators should be chained to ensure that the segments come from the same
     |  sequence.
     |
     |  >>> from numpy.random import Generator, Philox
     |  >>> bit_generator = Philox(1234)
     |  >>> rg = []
     |  >>> for _ in range(10):
     |  ...    rg.append(Generator(bit_generator))
     |  ...    bit_generator = bit_generator.jumped()
     |
     |  Alternatively, ``Philox`` can be used in parallel applications by using
     |  a sequence of distinct keys where each instance uses different key.
     |
     |  >>> key = 2**96 + 2**33 + 2**17 + 2**9
     |  >>> rg = [Generator(Philox(key=key+i)) for i in range(10)]
     |
     |  **Compatibility Guarantee**
     |
     |  ``Philox`` makes a guarantee that a fixed ``seed`` will always produce
     |  the same random integer stream.
     |
     |  Examples
     |  --------
     |  >>> from numpy.random import Generator, Philox
     |  >>> rg = Generator(Philox(1234))
     |  >>> rg.standard_normal()
     |  0.123  # random

     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      Advancing a RNG updates the underlying RNG state as-if a given
     |      number of calls to the underlying RNG have been made. In general
     |      there is not a one-to-one relationship between the number output
     |      random values from a particular distribution and the number of
     |      draws from the core RNG.  This occurs for two reasons:
     |
     |      * The random values are simulated using a rejection-based method
     |        and so, on average, more than one value from the underlying
     |        RNG is required to generate an single draw.
     |      * The number of bits required to generate a simulated value
     |        differs from the number of bits generated by the underlying
     |        RNG.  For example, two 16-bit integer values can be simulated
     |        from a single draw of a 32-bit RNG.
     |
     |      Advancing the RNG state resets any pre-computed random numbers.
     |      This is required to ensure exact reproducibility.
     |

     |  Consider using a different BitGenerator with the Generator container
     |  instead.
     |
     |  `RandomState` and `Generator` expose a number of methods for generating
     |  random numbers drawn from a variety of probability distributions. In
     |  addition to the distribution-specific arguments, each method takes a
     |  keyword argument `size` that defaults to ``None``. If `size` is ``None``,
     |  then a single value is generated and returned. If `size` is an integer,
     |  then a 1-D array filled with generated values is returned. If `size` is a
     |  tuple, then an array with that shape is filled and returned.
     |
     |  **Compatibility Guarantee**
     |
     |  A fixed bit generator using a fixed seed and a fixed series of calls to
     |  'RandomState' methods using the same parameters will always produce the
     |  same results up to roundoff error except when the values were incorrect.
     |  `RandomState` is effectively frozen and will only receive updates that
     |  are required by changes in the internals of Numpy. More substantial
     |  changes, including algorithmic improvements, are reserved for
     |  `Generator`.
     |
     |  Parameters
     |  ----------
     |  seed : {None, int, array_like, BitGenerator}, optional
     |      Random seed used to initialize the pseudo-random number generator or
     |      an instantized BitGenerator.  If an integer or array, used as a seed for
     |      the MT19937 BitGenerator. Values can be any integer between 0 and
     |      2**32 - 1 inclusive, an array (or other sequence) of such integers,
     |      or ``None`` (the default).  If `seed` is ``None``, then the `MT19937`
     |      BitGenerator is initialized by reading data from ``/dev/urandom``
     |      (or the Windows analogue) if available or seed from the clock
     |      otherwise.
     |
     |  Notes
     |  -----
     |  The Python stdlib module "random" also contains a Mersenne Twister
     |  pseudo-random number generator with a number of methods that are similar
     |  to the ones available in `RandomState`. `RandomState`, besides being
     |  NumPy-aware, has the advantage that it provides a much larger number
     |  of probability distributions to choose from.

     |  beta(...)
     |      beta(a, b, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from a Beta distribution.
     |
     |      The Beta distribution is a special case of the Dirichlet distribution,
     |      and is related to the Gamma distribution.  It has the probability
     |      distribution function
     |
     |      .. math:: f(x; a,b) = \frac{1}{B(\alpha, \beta)} x^{\alpha - 1}
     |                                                       (1 - x)^{\beta - 1},
     |
     |      where the normalization, B, is the beta function,
     |
     |      .. math:: B(\alpha, \beta) = \int_0^1 t^{\alpha - 1}
     |                                   (1 - t)^{\beta - 1} dt.
     |
     |      It is often seen in Bayesian inference and order statistics.
     |
     |      .. note::
     |          New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.beta`
     |          method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
     |          please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.
     |
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      a : float or array_like of floats
     |          Alpha, positive (>0).
     |      b : float or array_like of floats
     |          Beta, positive (>0).
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``a`` and ``b`` are both scalars.
     |          Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(a, b).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns

     |
     |      Samples are drawn from a binomial distribution with specified
     |      parameters, n trials and p probability of success where
     |      n an integer >= 0 and p is in the interval [0,1]. (n may be
     |      input as a float, but it is truncated to an integer in use)
     |
     |      .. note::
     |          New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.binomial`
     |          method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
     |          please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      n : int or array_like of ints
     |          Parameter of the distribution, >= 0. Floats are also accepted,
     |          but they will be truncated to integers.
     |      p : float or array_like of floats
     |          Parameter of the distribution, >= 0 and <=1.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``n`` and ``p`` are both scalars.
     |          Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(n, p).size`` samples are drawn.

     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized binomial distribution, where
     |          each sample is equal to the number of successes over the n trials.

     |          cumulative density function, etc.

     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density for the binomial distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: P(N) = \binom{n}{N}p^N(1-p)^{n-N},
     |
     |      where :math:`n` is the number of trials, :math:`p` is the probability
     |      of success, and :math:`N` is the number of successes.
     |
     |      When estimating the standard error of a proportion in a population by
     |      using a random sample, the normal distribution works well unless the
     |      product p*n <=5, where p = population proportion estimate, and n =
     |      number of samples, in which case the binomial distribution is used
     |      instead. For example, a sample of 15 people shows 4 who are left
     |      handed, and 11 who are right handed. Then p = 4/15 = 27%. 0.27*15 = 4,
     |      so the binomial distribution should be used in this case.

     |  chisquare(...)
     |      chisquare(df, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from a chi-square distribution.
     |
     |      When `df` independent random variables, each with standard normal
     |      distributions (mean 0, variance 1), are squared and summed, the
     |      resulting distribution is chi-square (see Notes).  This distribution
     |      is often used in hypothesis testing.

     |          method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
     |          please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      df : float or array_like of floats
     |           Number of degrees of freedom, must be > 0.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``df`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
     |          ``np.array(df).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized chi-square distribution.
     |
     |      Raises
     |      ------
     |      ValueError
     |          When `df` <= 0 or when an inappropriate `size` (e.g. ``size=-1``)
     |          is given.

     |          please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      a : 1-D array-like or int
     |          If an ndarray, a random sample is generated from its elements.
     |          If an int, the random sample is generated as if it were ``np.arange(a)``
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
     |          single value is returned.
     |      replace : boolean, optional
     |          Whether the sample is with or without replacement. Default is True,
     |          meaning that a value of ``a`` can be selected multiple times.
     |      p : 1-D array-like, optional
     |          The probabilities associated with each entry in a.
     |          If not given, the sample assumes a uniform distribution over all
     |          entries in ``a``.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      samples : single item or ndarray
     |          The generated random samples
     |
     |      Raises
     |      ------
     |      ValueError
     |          If a is an int and less than zero, if a or p are not 1-dimensional,
     |          if a is an array-like of size 0, if p is not a vector of
     |          probabilities, if a and p have different lengths, or if
     |          replace=False and the sample size is greater than the population
     |          size

     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      Setting user-specified probabilities through ``p`` uses a more general but less
     |      efficient sampler than the default. The general sampler produces a different sample
     |      than the optimized sampler even if each element of ``p`` is 1 / len(a).
     |
     |      Sampling random rows from a 2-D array is not possible with this function,
     |      but is possible with `Generator.choice` through its ``axis`` keyword.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      Generate a uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size 3:
     |
     |      >>> np.random.choice(5, 3)
     |      array([0, 3, 4]) # random
     |      >>> #This is equivalent to np.random.randint(0,5,3)
     |
     |      Generate a non-uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size 3:
     |
     |      >>> np.random.choice(5, 3, p=[0.1, 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0])
     |      array([3, 3, 0]) # random
     |
     |      Generate a uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size 3 without
     |      replacement:
     |
     |      >>> np.random.choice(5, 3, replace=False)
     |      array([3,1,0]) # random
     |      >>> #This is equivalent to np.random.permutation(np.arange(5))[:3]
     |
     |      Generate a non-uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size
     |      3 without replacement:
     |
     |      >>> np.random.choice(5, 3, replace=False, p=[0.1, 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0])
     |      array([2, 3, 0]) # random
     |
     |      Any of the above can be repeated with an arbitrary array-like
     |      instead of just integers. For instance:
     |
     |      >>> aa_milne_arr = ['pooh', 'rabbit', 'piglet', 'Christopher']
     |      >>> np.random.choice(aa_milne_arr, 5, p=[0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 0.3])
     |      array(['pooh', 'pooh', 'pooh', 'Christopher', 'piglet'], # random

     |  dirichlet(...)
     |      dirichlet(alpha, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from the Dirichlet distribution.
     |
     |      Draw `size` samples of dimension k from a Dirichlet distribution. A
     |      Dirichlet-distributed random variable can be seen as a multivariate
     |      generalization of a Beta distribution. The Dirichlet distribution
     |      is a conjugate prior of a multinomial distribution in Bayesian
     |      inference.
     |
     |      .. note::
     |          New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.dirichlet`
     |          method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
     |          please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      alpha : sequence of floats, length k
     |          Parameter of the distribution (length ``k`` for sample of
     |          length ``k``).
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
     |          vector of length ``k`` is returned.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      samples : ndarray,
     |          The drawn samples, of shape ``(size, k)``.
     |
     |      Raises
     |      ------
     |      ValueError
     |          If any value in ``alpha`` is less than or equal to zero
     |
     |      See Also
     |      --------
     |      random.Generator.dirichlet: which should be used for new code.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The Dirichlet distribution is a distribution over vectors
     |      :math:`x` that fulfil the conditions :math:`x_i>0` and
     |      :math:`\sum_{i=1}^k x_i = 1`.
     |
     |      The probability density function :math:`p` of a
     |      Dirichlet-distributed random vector :math:`X` is
     |      proportional to
     |
     |      .. math:: p(x) \propto \prod_{i=1}^{k}{x^{\alpha_i-1}_i},
     |
     |      where :math:`\alpha` is a vector containing the positive
     |      concentration parameters.
     |
     |      The method uses the following property for computation: let :math:`Y`
     |      be a random vector which has components that follow a standard gamma
     |      distribution, then :math:`X = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^k{Y_i}} Y`
     |      is Dirichlet-distributed

     |  exponential(...)
     |      exponential(scale=1.0, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from an exponential distribution.
     |
     |      Its probability density function is
     |
     |      .. math:: f(x; \frac{1}{\beta}) = \frac{1}{\beta} \exp(-\frac{x}{\beta}),
     |
     |      for ``x > 0`` and 0 elsewhere. :math:`\beta` is the scale parameter,
     |      which is the inverse of the rate parameter :math:`\lambda = 1/\beta`.
     |      The rate parameter is an alternative, widely used parameterization
     |      of the exponential distribution [3]_.
     |
     |      The exponential distribution is a continuous analogue of the
     |      geometric distribution.  It describes many common situations, such as
     |      the size of raindrops measured over many rainstorms [1]_, or the time
     |      between page requests to Wikipedia [2]_.

     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      scale : float or array_like of floats
     |          The scale parameter, :math:`\beta = 1/\lambda`. Must be
     |          non-negative.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``scale`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
     |          ``np.array(scale).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized exponential distribution.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      A real world example: Assume a company has 10000 customer support
     |      agents and the average time between customer calls is 4 minutes.
     |
     |      >>> n = 10000
     |      >>> time_between_calls = np.random.default_rng().exponential(scale=4, size=n)
     |
     |      What is the probability that a customer will call in the next
     |      4 to 5 minutes?
     |
     |      >>> x = ((time_between_calls < 5).sum())/n

     |      freedom in denominator), where both parameters must be greater than
     |      zero.
     |
     |      The random variate of the F distribution (also known as the
     |      Fisher distribution) is a continuous probability distribution
     |      that arises in ANOVA tests, and is the ratio of two chi-square
     |      variates.

     |          New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.f`
     |          method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
     |          please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      dfnum : float or array_like of floats
     |          Degrees of freedom in numerator, must be > 0.
     |      dfden : float or array_like of float
     |          Degrees of freedom in denominator, must be > 0.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``dfnum`` and ``dfden`` are both scalars.
     |          Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(dfnum, dfden).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized Fisher distribution.

     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The F statistic is used to compare in-group variances to between-group
     |      variances. Calculating the distribution depends on the sampling, and
     |      so it is a function of the respective degrees of freedom in the
     |      problem.  The variable `dfnum` is the number of samples minus one, the
     |      between-groups degrees of freedom, while `dfden` is the within-groups
     |      degrees of freedom, the sum of the number of samples in each group
     |      minus the number of groups.

     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      An example from Glantz[1], pp 47-40:
     |
     |      Two groups, children of diabetics (25 people) and children from people
     |      without diabetes (25 controls). Fasting blood glucose was measured,
     |      case group had a mean value of 86.1, controls had a mean value of
     |      82.2. Standard deviations were 2.09 and 2.49 respectively. Are these
     |      data consistent with the null hypothesis that the parents diabetic
     |      status does not affect their children's blood glucose levels?
     |      Calculating the F statistic from the data gives a value of 36.01.
     |
     |      Draw samples from the distribution:
     |
     |      >>> dfnum = 1. # between group degrees of freedom
     |      >>> dfden = 48. # within groups degrees of freedom
     |      >>> s = np.random.f(dfnum, dfden, 1000)
     |
     |      The lower bound for the top 1% of the samples is :
     |
     |      >>> np.sort(s)[-10]
     |      7.61988120985 # random
     |
     |      So there is about a 1% chance that the F statistic will exceed 7.62,
     |      the measured value is 36, so the null hypothesis is rejected at the 1%
     |      level.
     |
     |  gamma(...)
     |      gamma(shape, scale=1.0, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from a Gamma distribution.
     |
     |      Samples are drawn from a Gamma distribution with specified parameters,
     |      `shape` (sometimes designated "k") and `scale` (sometimes designated
     |      "theta"), where both parameters are > 0.
     |
     |      .. note::
     |          New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.gamma`
     |          method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
     |          please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      shape : float or array_like of floats
     |          The shape of the gamma distribution. Must be non-negative.
     |      scale : float or array_like of floats, optional
     |          The scale of the gamma distribution. Must be non-negative.
     |          Default is equal to 1.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``shape`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
     |          Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(shape, scale).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized gamma distribution.

     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density for the Gamma distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: p(x) = x^{k-1}\frac{e^{-x/\theta}}{\theta^k\Gamma(k)},
     |
     |      where :math:`k` is the shape and :math:`\theta` the scale,
     |      and :math:`\Gamma` is the Gamma function.
     |
     |      The Gamma distribution is often used to model the times to failure of
     |      electronic components, and arises naturally in processes for which the
     |      waiting times between Poisson distributed events are relevant.

     |      Draw samples from the geometric distribution.
     |
     |      Bernoulli trials are experiments with one of two outcomes:
     |      success or failure (an example of such an experiment is flipping
     |      a coin).  The geometric distribution models the number of trials
     |      that must be run in order to achieve success.  It is therefore
     |      supported on the positive integers, ``k = 1, 2, ...``.
     |
     |      The probability mass function of the geometric distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: f(k) = (1 - p)^{k - 1} p
     |
     |      where `p` is the probability of success of an individual trial.

     |          The probability of success of an individual trial.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``p`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
     |          ``np.array(p).size`` samples are drawn.

     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      legacy : bool, optional
     |          Flag indicating to return a legacy tuple state when the BitGenerator
     |          is MT19937, instead of a dict. Raises ValueError if the underlying
     |          bit generator is not an instance of MT19937.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : {tuple(str, ndarray of 624 uints, int, int, float), dict}
     |          If legacy is True, the returned tuple has the following items:
     |
     |          1. the string 'MT19937'.
     |          2. a 1-D array of 624 unsigned integer keys.
     |          3. an integer ``pos``.
     |          4. an integer ``has_gauss``.
     |          5. a float ``cached_gaussian``.
     |
     |          If `legacy` is False, or the BitGenerator is not MT19937, then

     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The Gumbel (or Smallest Extreme Value (SEV) or the Smallest Extreme
     |      Value Type I) distribution is one of a class of Generalized Extreme
     |      Value (GEV) distributions used in modeling extreme value problems.
     |      The Gumbel is a special case of the Extreme Value Type I distribution
     |      for maximums from distributions with "exponential-like" tails.
     |
     |      The probability density for the Gumbel distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: p(x) = \frac{e^{-(x - \mu)/ \beta}}{\beta} e^{ -e^{-(x - \mu)/
     |                \beta}},
     |
     |      where :math:`\mu` is the mode, a location parameter, and
     |      :math:`\beta` is the scale parameter.
     |
     |      The Gumbel (named for German mathematician Emil Julius Gumbel) was used
     |      very early in the hydrology literature, for modeling the occurrence of
     |      flood events. It is also used for modeling maximum wind speed and
     |      rainfall rates.  It is a "fat-tailed" distribution - the probability of
     |      an event in the tail of the distribution is larger than if one used a
     |      Gaussian, hence the surprisingly frequent occurrence of 100-year
     |      floods. Floods were initially modeled as a Gaussian process, which
     |      underestimated the frequency of extreme events.
     |
     |      It is one of a class of extreme value distributions, the Generalized
     |      Extreme Value (GEV) distributions, which also includes the Weibull and
     |      Frechet.
     |
     |      The function has a mean of :math:`\mu + 0.57721\beta` and a variance
     |      of :math:`\frac{\pi^2}{6}\beta^2`.

     |          are all scalars.  Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(ngood, nbad, nsample).size``
     |          samples are drawn.

     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized hypergeometric distribution. Each
     |          sample is the number of good items within a randomly selected subset of
     |          size `nsample` taken from a set of `ngood` good items and `nbad` bad items.

     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density for the Hypergeometric distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: P(x) = \frac{\binom{g}{x}\binom{b}{n-x}}{\binom{g+b}{n}},
     |
     |      where :math:`0 \le x \le n` and :math:`n-b \le x \le g`
     |
     |      for P(x) the probability of ``x`` good results in the drawn sample,
     |      g = `ngood`, b = `nbad`, and n = `nsample`.
     |
     |      Consider an urn with black and white marbles in it, `ngood` of them
     |      are black and `nbad` are white. If you draw `nsample` balls without
     |      replacement, then the hypergeometric distribution describes the
     |      distribution of black balls in the drawn sample.
     |
     |      Note that this distribution is very similar to the binomial
     |      distribution, except that in this case, samples are drawn without
     |      replacement, whereas in the Binomial case samples are drawn with
     |      replacement (or the sample space is infinite). As the sample space
     |      becomes large, this distribution approaches the binomial.

     |      Draw samples from the distribution:
     |
     |      >>> ngood, nbad, nsamp = 100, 2, 10
     |      # number of good, number of bad, and number of samples

     |  laplace(...)
     |      laplace(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from the Laplace or double exponential distribution with
     |      specified location (or mean) and scale (decay).
     |
     |      The Laplace distribution is similar to the Gaussian/normal distribution,
     |      but is sharper at the peak and has fatter tails. It represents the
     |      difference between two independent, identically distributed exponential
     |      random variables.
     |
     |      .. note::
     |          New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.laplace`
     |          method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
     |          please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      loc : float or array_like of floats, optional
     |          The position, :math:`\mu`, of the distribution peak. Default is 0.
     |      scale : float or array_like of floats, optional
     |          :math:`\lambda`, the exponential decay. Default is 1. Must be non-
     |          negative.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``loc`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
     |          Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(loc, scale).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized Laplace distribution.

     |      It has the probability density function
     |
     |      .. math:: f(x; \mu, \lambda) = \frac{1}{2\lambda}
     |                                     \exp\left(-\frac{|x - \mu|}{\lambda}\right).
     |
     |      The first law of Laplace, from 1774, states that the frequency
     |      of an error can be expressed as an exponential function of the
     |      absolute magnitude of the error, which leads to the Laplace
     |      distribution. For many problems in economics and health
     |      sciences, this distribution seems to model the data better
     |      than the standard Gaussian distribution.

     |      Notes

     |      -----
     |      A variable `x` has a log-normal distribution if `log(x)` is normally

     |
     |      where :math:`\mu` is the mean and :math:`\sigma` is the standard
     |      deviation of the normally distributed logarithm of the variable.
     |      A log-normal distribution results if a random variable is the *product*
     |      of a large number of independent, identically-distributed variables in
     |      the same way that a normal distribution results if the variable is the

     |      Draw samples from the distribution:
     |
     |      >>> a = .6
     |      >>> s = np.random.logseries(a, 10000)

     |  multinomial(...)
     |      multinomial(n, pvals, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from a multinomial distribution.
     |
     |      The multinomial distribution is a multivariate generalization of the
     |      binomial distribution.  Take an experiment with one of ``p``
     |      possible outcomes.  An example of such an experiment is throwing a dice,
     |      where the outcome can be 1 through 6.  Each sample drawn from the
     |      distribution represents `n` such experiments.  Its values,
     |      ``X_i = [X_0, X_1, ..., X_p]``, represent the number of times the
     |      outcome was ``i``.
     |
     |      .. note::
     |          New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.multinomial`
     |          method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
     |          please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      n : int
     |          Number of experiments.
     |      pvals : sequence of floats, length p
     |          Probabilities of each of the ``p`` different outcomes.  These
     |          must sum to 1 (however, the last element is always assumed to
     |          account for the remaining probability, as long as
     |          ``sum(pvals[:-1]) <= 1)``.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
     |          single value is returned.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray
     |          The drawn samples, of shape *size*, if that was provided.  If not,
     |          the shape is ``(N,)``.
     |
     |          In other words, each entry ``out[i,j,...,:]`` is an N-dimensional
     |          value drawn from the distribution.

     |      random.Generator.multinomial: which should be used for new code.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      Throw a dice 20 times:
     |
     |      >>> np.random.multinomial(20, [1/6.]*6, size=1)
     |      array([[4, 1, 7, 5, 2, 1]]) # random
     |
     |      It landed 4 times on 1, once on 2, etc.
     |
     |      Now, throw the dice 20 times, and 20 times again:
     |
     |      >>> np.random.multinomial(20, [1/6.]*6, size=2)
     |      array([[3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3], # random
     |             [2, 4, 3, 4, 0, 7]])
     |
     |      For the first run, we threw 3 times 1, 4 times 2, etc.  For the second,
     |      we threw 2 times 1, 4 times 2, etc.
     |
     |      A loaded die is more likely to land on number 6:
     |
     |      >>> np.random.multinomial(100, [1/7.]*5 + [2/7.])
     |      array([11, 16, 14, 17, 16, 26]) # random
     |
     |      The probability inputs should be normalized. As an implementation
     |      detail, the value of the last entry is ignored and assumed to take
     |      up any leftover probability mass, but this should not be relied on.
     |      A biased coin which has twice as much weight on one side as on the
     |      other should be sampled like so:
     |
     |      >>> np.random.multinomial(100, [1.0 / 3, 2.0 / 3])  # RIGHT
     |      array([38, 62]) # random
     |
     |      not like:
     |
     |      >>> np.random.multinomial(100, [1.0, 2.0])  # WRONG
     |      Traceback (most recent call last):
     |      ValueError: pvals < 0, pvals > 1 or pvals contains NaNs
     |
     |  multivariate_normal(...)
     |      multivariate_normal(mean, cov, size=None, check_valid='warn', tol=1e-8)
     |
     |      Draw random samples from a multivariate normal distribution.
     |
     |      The multivariate normal, multinormal or Gaussian distribution is a
     |      generalization of the one-dimensional normal distribution to higher
     |      dimensions.  Such a distribution is specified by its mean and
     |      covariance matrix.  These parameters are analogous to the mean
     |      (average or "center") and variance (standard deviation, or "width,"
     |      squared) of the one-dimensional normal distribution.
     |
     |      .. note::
     |          New code should use the
     |          `~numpy.random.Generator.multivariate_normal`
     |          method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
     |          please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      mean : 1-D array_like, of length N
     |          Mean of the N-dimensional distribution.
     |      cov : 2-D array_like, of shape (N, N)
     |          Covariance matrix of the distribution. It must be symmetric and
     |          positive-semidefinite for proper sampling.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Given a shape of, for example, ``(m,n,k)``, ``m*n*k`` samples are
     |          generated, and packed in an `m`-by-`n`-by-`k` arrangement.  Because
     |          each sample is `N`-dimensional, the output shape is ``(m,n,k,N)``.
     |          If no shape is specified, a single (`N`-D) sample is returned.
     |      check_valid : { 'warn', 'raise', 'ignore' }, optional
     |          Behavior when the covariance matrix is not positive semidefinite.
     |      tol : float, optional
     |          Tolerance when checking the singular values in covariance matrix.
     |          cov is cast to double before the check.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray
     |          The drawn samples, of shape *size*, if that was provided.  If not,
     |          the shape is ``(N,)``.
     |
     |          In other words, each entry ``out[i,j,...,:]`` is an N-dimensional
     |          value drawn from the distribution.
     |
     |      See Also
     |      --------
     |      random.Generator.multivariate_normal: which should be used for new code.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The mean is a coordinate in N-dimensional space, which represents the
     |      location where samples are most likely to be generated.  This is
     |      analogous to the peak of the bell curve for the one-dimensional or
     |      univariate normal distribution.
     |
     |      Covariance indicates the level to which two variables vary together.
     |      From the multivariate normal distribution, we draw N-dimensional
     |      samples, :math:`X = [x_1, x_2, ... x_N]`.  The covariance matrix
     |      element :math:`C_{ij}` is the covariance of :math:`x_i` and :math:`x_j`.
     |      The element :math:`C_{ii}` is the variance of :math:`x_i` (i.e. its
     |      "spread").
     |
     |      Instead of specifying the full covariance matrix, popular
     |      approximations include:
     |
     |        - Spherical covariance (`cov` is a multiple of the identity matrix)
     |        - Diagonal covariance (`cov` has non-negative elements, and only on
     |          the diagonal)
     |
     |      This geometrical property can be seen in two dimensions by plotting
     |      generated data-points:
     |
     |      >>> mean = [0, 0]
     |      >>> cov = [[1, 0], [0, 100]]  # diagonal covariance
     |
     |      Diagonal covariance means that points are oriented along x or y-axis:
     |
     |      >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
     |      >>> x, y = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean, cov, 5000).T
     |      >>> plt.plot(x, y, 'x')
     |      >>> plt.axis('equal')
     |      >>> plt.show()
     |
     |      Note that the covariance matrix must be positive semidefinite (a.k.a.
     |      nonnegative-definite). Otherwise, the behavior of this method is
     |      undefined and backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.

     |      Here we generate 800 samples from the bivariate normal distribution
     |      with mean [0, 0] and covariance matrix [[6, -3], [-3, 3.5]].  The
     |      expected variances of the first and second components of the sample
     |      are 6 and 3.5, respectively, and the expected correlation
     |      coefficient is -3/sqrt(6*3.5) ≈ -0.65465.
     |
     |      >>> cov = np.array([[6, -3], [-3, 3.5]])
     |      >>> pts = np.random.multivariate_normal([0, 0], cov, size=800)

     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),

     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized negative binomial distribution,
     |          where each sample is equal to N, the number of failures that
     |          occurred before a total of n successes was reached.

     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability mass function of the negative binomial distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: P(N;n,p) = \frac{\Gamma(N+n)}{N!\Gamma(n)}p^{n}(1-p)^{N},
     |
     |      where :math:`n` is the number of successes, :math:`p` is the
     |      probability of success, :math:`N+n` is the number of trials, and
     |      :math:`\Gamma` is the gamma function. When :math:`n` is an integer,
     |      :math:`\frac{\Gamma(N+n)}{N!\Gamma(n)} = \binom{N+n-1}{N}`, which is
     |      the more common form of this term in the pmf. The negative
     |      binomial distribution gives the probability of N failures given n
     |      successes, with a success on the last trial.
     |
     |      If one throws a die repeatedly until the third time a "1" appears,
     |      then the probability distribution of the number of non-"1"s that
     |      appear before the third "1" is a negative binomial distribution.

     |  noncentral_f(...)
     |      noncentral_f(dfnum, dfden, nonc, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from the noncentral F distribution.
     |
     |      Samples are drawn from an F distribution with specified parameters,
     |      `dfnum` (degrees of freedom in numerator) and `dfden` (degrees of
     |      freedom in denominator), where both parameters > 1.
     |      `nonc` is the non-centrality parameter.
     |
     |      .. note::
     |          New code should use the
     |          `~numpy.random.Generator.noncentral_f`
     |          method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
     |          please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      dfnum : float or array_like of floats
     |          Numerator degrees of freedom, must be > 0.
     |
     |          .. versionchanged:: 1.14.0
     |             Earlier NumPy versions required dfnum > 1.
     |      dfden : float or array_like of floats
     |          Denominator degrees of freedom, must be > 0.
     |      nonc : float or array_like of floats
     |          Non-centrality parameter, the sum of the squares of the numerator
     |          means, must be >= 0.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``dfnum``, ``dfden``, and ``nonc``
     |          are all scalars.  Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(dfnum, dfden, nonc).size``
     |          samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized noncentral Fisher distribution.

     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      When calculating the power of an experiment (power = probability of
     |      rejecting the null hypothesis when a specific alternative is true) the
     |      non-central F statistic becomes important.  When the null hypothesis is
     |      true, the F statistic follows a central F distribution. When the null
     |      hypothesis is not true, then it follows a non-central F statistic.

     |      In a study, testing for a specific alternative to the null hypothesis
     |      requires use of the Noncentral F distribution. We need to calculate the
     |      area in the tail of the distribution that exceeds the value of the F
     |      distribution for the null hypothesis.  We'll plot the two probability
     |      distributions for comparison.

     |  normal(...)
     |      normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw random samples from a normal (Gaussian) distribution.
     |
     |      The probability density function of the normal distribution, first
     |      derived by De Moivre and 200 years later by both Gauss and Laplace
     |      independently [2]_, is often called the bell curve because of
     |      its characteristic shape (see the example below).
     |
     |      The normal distributions occurs often in nature.  For example, it
     |      describes the commonly occurring distribution of samples influenced
     |      by a large number of tiny, random disturbances, each with its own
     |      unique distribution [2]_.
     |
     |      .. note::
     |          New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.normal`
     |          method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
     |          please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      loc : float or array_like of floats
     |          Mean ("centre") of the distribution.
     |      scale : float or array_like of floats
     |          Standard deviation (spread or "width") of the distribution. Must be
     |          non-negative.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``loc`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
     |          Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(loc, scale).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized normal distribution.

     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density for the Gaussian distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: p(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 \pi \sigma^2 }}
     |                       e^{ - \frac{ (x - \mu)^2 } {2 \sigma^2} },
     |
     |      where :math:`\mu` is the mean and :math:`\sigma` the standard
     |      deviation. The square of the standard deviation, :math:`\sigma^2`,
     |      is called the variance.
     |
     |      The function has its peak at the mean, and its "spread" increases with
     |      the standard deviation (the function reaches 0.607 times its maximum at
     |      :math:`x + \sigma` and :math:`x - \sigma` [2]_).  This implies that
     |      normal is more likely to return samples lying close to the mean, rather
     |      than those far away.

     |      >>> s = np.random.normal(mu, sigma, 1000)

     |
     |  pareto(...)
     |      pareto(a, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from a Pareto II or Lomax distribution with
     |      specified shape.
     |
     |      The Lomax or Pareto II distribution is a shifted Pareto
     |      distribution. The classical Pareto distribution can be
     |      obtained from the Lomax distribution by adding 1 and
     |      multiplying by the scale parameter ``m`` (see Notes).  The
     |      smallest value of the Lomax distribution is zero while for the
     |      classical Pareto distribution it is ``mu``, where the standard
     |      Pareto distribution has location ``mu = 1``.  Lomax can also
     |      be considered as a simplified version of the Generalized
     |      Pareto distribution (available in SciPy), with the scale set
     |      to one and the location set to zero.
     |
     |      The Pareto distribution must be greater than zero, and is
     |      unbounded above.  It is also known as the "80-20 rule".  In
     |      this distribution, 80 percent of the weights are in the lowest
     |      20 percent of the range, while the other 20 percent fill the
     |      remaining 80 percent of the range.

     |          Shape of the distribution. Must be positive.

     |          a single value is returned if ``a`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
     |          ``np.array(a).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns

     |      Notes

     |
     |      The Pareto distribution, named after the Italian economist
     |      Vilfredo Pareto, is a power law probability distribution
     |      useful in many real world problems.  Outside the field of
     |      economics it is generally referred to as the Bradford
     |      distribution. Pareto developed the distribution to describe
     |      the distribution of wealth in an economy.  It has also found
     |      use in insurance, web page access statistics, oil field sizes,
     |      and many other problems, including the download frequency for
     |      projects in Sourceforge [1]_.  It is one of the so-called
     |      "fat-tailed" distributions.

     |      For events with an expected separation :math:`\lambda` the Poisson
     |      distribution :math:`f(k; \lambda)` describes the probability of
     |      :math:`k` events occurring within the observed
     |      interval :math:`\lambda`.
     |
     |      Because the output is limited to the range of the C int64 type, a
     |      ValueError is raised when `lam` is within 10 sigma of the maximum
     |      representable value.

     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      Draw samples from the distribution:
     |
     |      >>> import numpy as np
     |      >>> s = np.random.poisson(5, 10000)
     |
     |      Display histogram of the sample:
     |
     |      >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
     |      >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s, 14, density=True)
     |      >>> plt.show()
     |
     |      Draw each 100 values for lambda 100 and 500:
     |
     |      >>> s = np.random.poisson(lam=(100., 500.), size=(100, 2))
     |
     |  power(...)
     |      power(a, size=None)
     |
     |      Draws samples in [0, 1] from a power distribution with positive
     |      exponent a - 1.
     |
     |      Also known as the power function distribution.
     |
     |      .. note::
     |          New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.power`
     |          method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
     |          please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      a : float or array_like of floats
     |          Parameter of the distribution. Must be non-negative.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``a`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
     |          ``np.array(a).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized power distribution.
     |
     |      Raises
     |      ------
     |      ValueError
     |          If a <= 0.

     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density function is
     |
     |      .. math:: P(x; a) = ax^{a-1}, 0 \le x \le 1, a>0.
     |
     |      The power function distribution is just the inverse of the Pareto
     |      distribution. It may also be seen as a special case of the Beta
     |      distribution.
     |
     |      It is used, for example, in modeling the over-reporting of insurance
     |      claims.

     |      ----------
     |      low : int or array-like of ints
     |          Lowest (signed) integers to be drawn from the distribution (unless

     |          If array-like, must contain integer values
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional

     |          please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.
     |
     |      If positive int_like arguments are provided, `randn` generates an array

     |      with random floats sampled from a univariate "normal" (Gaussian)
     |      distribution of mean 0 and variance 1. A single float randomly sampled
     |      from the distribution is returned if no argument is provided.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      d0, d1, ..., dn : int, optional
     |          The dimensions of the returned array, must be non-negative.

     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      Z : ndarray or float
     |          A ``(d0, d1, ..., dn)``-shaped array of floating-point samples from
     |          the standard normal distribution, or a single such float if

     |
     |      Examples

     |      >>> np.random.randn()
     |      2.1923875335537315  # random
     |
     |      Two-by-four array of samples from the normal distribution with

     |
     |  random(...)
     |      random(size=None)
     |
     |      Return random floats in the half-open interval [0.0, 1.0). Alias for
     |      `random_sample` to ease forward-porting to the new random API.
     |
     |  random_integers(...)
     |      random_integers(low, high=None, size=None)
     |
     |      Random integers of type `np.int_` between `low` and `high`, inclusive.
     |
     |      Return random integers of type `np.int_` from the "discrete uniform"
     |      distribution in the closed interval [`low`, `high`].  If `high` is
     |      None (the default), then results are from [1, `low`]. The `np.int_`
     |      type translates to the C long integer type and its precision
     |      is platform dependent.

     |          If provided, the largest (signed) integer to be drawn from the
     |          distribution (see above for behavior if ``high=None``).
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then

     |  rayleigh(...)
     |      rayleigh(scale=1.0, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from a Rayleigh distribution.
     |
     |      The :math:`\chi` and Weibull distributions are generalizations of the
     |      Rayleigh.
     |
     |      .. note::
     |          New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.rayleigh`
     |          method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
     |          please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      scale : float or array_like of floats, optional
     |          Scale, also equals the mode. Must be non-negative. Default is 1.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``scale`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
     |          ``np.array(scale).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized Rayleigh distribution.
     |
     |      See Also
     |      --------
     |      random.Generator.rayleigh: which should be used for new code.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density function for the Rayleigh distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: P(x;scale) = \frac{x}{scale^2}e^{\frac{-x^2}{2 \cdotp scale^2}}
     |
     |      The Rayleigh distribution would arise, for example, if the East
     |      and North components of the wind velocity had identical zero-mean
     |      Gaussian distributions.  Then the wind speed would have a Rayleigh
     |      distribution.

     |      Reseed a legacy MT19937 BitGenerator
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      This is a convenience, legacy function.
     |
     |      The best practice is to **not** reseed a BitGenerator, rather to
     |      recreate a new one. This method is here for legacy reasons.
     |      This example demonstrates best practice.
     |
     |      >>> from numpy.random import MT19937
     |      >>> from numpy.random import RandomState, SeedSequence
     |      >>> rs = RandomState(MT19937(SeedSequence(123456789)))
     |      # Later, you want to restart the stream
     |      >>> rs = RandomState(MT19937(SeedSequence(987654321)))
     |
     |  set_state(...)
     |      set_state(state)
     |
     |      Set the internal state of the generator from a tuple.
     |
     |      For use if one has reason to manually (re-)set the internal state of
     |      the bit generator used by the RandomState instance. By default,
     |      RandomState uses the "Mersenne Twister"[1]_ pseudo-random number
     |      generating algorithm.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      state : {tuple(str, ndarray of 624 uints, int, int, float), dict}
     |          The `state` tuple has the following items:
     |
     |          1. the string 'MT19937', specifying the Mersenne Twister algorithm.
     |          2. a 1-D array of 624 unsigned integers ``keys``.
     |          3. an integer ``pos``.
     |          4. an integer ``has_gauss``.
     |          5. a float ``cached_gaussian``.
     |
     |          If state is a dictionary, it is directly set using the BitGenerators
     |          `state` property.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : None
     |          Returns 'None' on success.
     |
     |      See Also
     |      --------
     |      get_state
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      `set_state` and `get_state` are not needed to work with any of the
     |      random distributions in NumPy. If the internal state is manually altered,
     |      the user should know exactly what he/she is doing.
     |
     |      For backwards compatibility, the form (str, array of 624 uints, int) is
     |      also accepted although it is missing some information about the cached
     |      Gaussian value: ``state = ('MT19937', keys, pos)``.

     |  standard_cauchy(...)

     |
     |      Also known as the Lorentz distribution.
     |
     |      .. note::
     |          New code should use the
     |          `~numpy.random.Generator.standard_cauchy`
     |          method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
     |          please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
     |          single value is returned.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      samples : ndarray or scalar
     |          The drawn samples.
     |
     |      See Also
     |      --------
     |      random.Generator.standard_cauchy: which should be used for new code.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density function for the full Cauchy distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: P(x; x_0, \gamma) = \frac{1}{\pi \gamma \bigl[ 1+
     |                (\frac{x-x_0}{\gamma})^2 \bigr] }
     |
     |      and the Standard Cauchy distribution just sets :math:`x_0=0` and
     |      :math:`\gamma=1`
     |
     |      The Cauchy distribution arises in the solution to the driven harmonic
     |      oscillator problem, and also describes spectral line broadening. It
     |      also describes the distribution of values at which a line tilted at
     |      a random angle will cut the x axis.
     |
     |      When studying hypothesis tests that assume normality, seeing how the
     |      tests perform on data from a Cauchy distribution is a good indicator of
     |      their sensitivity to a heavy-tailed distribution, since the Cauchy looks
     |      very much like a Gaussian distribution, but with heavier tails.

     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      shape : float or array_like of floats
     |          Parameter, must be non-negative.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional

     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density for the Gamma distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: p(x) = x^{k-1}\frac{e^{-x/\theta}}{\theta^k\Gamma(k)},
     |
     |      where :math:`k` is the shape and :math:`\theta` the scale,
     |      and :math:`\Gamma` is the Gamma function.
     |
     |      The Gamma distribution is often used to model the times to failure of
     |      electronic components, and arises naturally in processes for which the
     |      waiting times between Poisson distributed events are relevant.

     |  standard_t(...)
     |      standard_t(df, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from a standard Student's t distribution with `df` degrees
     |      of freedom.
     |
     |      A special case of the hyperbolic distribution.  As `df` gets
     |      large, the result resembles that of the standard normal
     |      distribution (`standard_normal`).
     |
     |      .. note::
     |          New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.standard_t`
     |          method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
     |          please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      df : float or array_like of floats
     |          Degrees of freedom, must be > 0.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``df`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
     |          ``np.array(df).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized standard Student's t distribution.
     |
     |      See Also

     |      random.Generator.standard_t: which should be used for new code.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density function for the t distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: P(x, df) = \frac{\Gamma(\frac{df+1}{2})}{\sqrt{\pi df}
     |                \Gamma(\frac{df}{2})}\Bigl( 1+\frac{x^2}{df} \Bigr)^{-(df+1)/2}
     |
     |      The t test is based on an assumption that the data come from a
     |      Normal distribution. The t test provides a way to test whether
     |      the sample mean (that is the mean calculated from the data) is
     |      a good estimate of the true mean.
     |
     |      The derivation of the t-distribution was first published in
     |      1908 by William Gosset while working for the Guinness Brewery
     |      in Dublin. Due to proprietary issues, he had to publish under
     |      a pseudonym, and so he used the name Student.

     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      From Dalgaard page 83 [1]_, suppose the daily energy intake for 11
     |      women in kilojoules (kJ) is:
     |
     |      >>> intake = np.array([5260., 5470, 5640, 6180, 6390, 6515, 6805, 7515, \
     |      ...                    7515, 8230, 8770])
     |
     |      Does their energy intake deviate systematically from the recommended
     |      value of 7725 kJ? Our null hypothesis will be the absence of deviation,
     |      and the alternate hypothesis will be the presence of an effect that could be
     |      either positive or negative, hence making our test 2-tailed.
     |
     |      Because we are estimating the mean and we have N=11 values in our sample,
     |      we have N-1=10 degrees of freedom. We set our significance level to 95% and
     |      compute the t statistic using the empirical mean and empirical standard
     |      deviation of our intake. We use a ddof of 1 to base the computation of our
     |      empirical standard deviation on an unbiased estimate of the variance (note:
     |      the final estimate is not unbiased due to the concave nature of the square
     |      root).
     |
     |      >>> np.mean(intake)
     |      6753.636363636364
     |      >>> intake.std(ddof=1)
     |      1142.1232221373727
     |      >>> t = (np.mean(intake)-7725)/(intake.std(ddof=1)/np.sqrt(len(intake)))
     |      >>> t
     |      -2.8207540608310198
     |
     |      We draw 1000000 samples from Student's t distribution with the adequate
     |      degrees of freedom.
     |
     |      >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
     |      >>> s = np.random.standard_t(10, size=1000000)
     |      >>> h = plt.hist(s, bins=100, density=True)
     |
     |      Does our t statistic land in one of the two critical regions found at
     |      both tails of the distribution?
     |
     |      >>> np.sum(np.abs(t) < np.abs(s)) / float(len(s))
     |      0.018318  #random < 0.05, statistic is in critical region
     |
     |      The probability value for this 2-tailed test is about 1.83%, which is
     |      lower than the 5% pre-determined significance threshold.
     |
     |      Therefore, the probability of observing values as extreme as our intake
     |      conditionally on the null hypothesis being true is too low, and we reject
     |      the null hypothesis of no deviation.

     |  tomaxint(...)
     |      tomaxint(size=None)
     |
     |      Return a sample of uniformly distributed random integers in the interval
     |      [0, ``np.iinfo(np.int_).max``]. The `np.int_` type translates to the C long
     |      integer type and its precision is platform dependent.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then

     |          single value is returned.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------

     |  triangular(...)
     |      triangular(left, mode, right, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from the triangular distribution over the
     |      interval ``[left, right]``.
     |
     |      The triangular distribution is a continuous probability
     |      distribution with lower limit left, peak at mode, and upper
     |      limit right. Unlike the other distributions, these parameters
     |      directly define the shape of the pdf.
     |
     |      .. note::
     |          New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.triangular`
     |          method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
     |          please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      left : float or array_like of floats
     |          Lower limit.
     |      mode : float or array_like of floats
     |          The value where the peak of the distribution occurs.
     |          The value must fulfill the condition ``left <= mode <= right``.
     |      right : float or array_like of floats
     |          Upper limit, must be larger than `left`.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``left``, ``mode``, and ``right``
     |          are all scalars.  Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(left, mode, right).size``
     |          samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized triangular distribution.
     |
     |      See Also
     |      --------
     |      random.Generator.triangular: which should be used for new code.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density function for the triangular distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: P(x;l, m, r) = \begin{cases}
     |                \frac{2(x-l)}{(r-l)(m-l)}& \text{for $l \leq x \leq m$},\\
     |                \frac{2(r-x)}{(r-l)(r-m)}& \text{for $m \leq x \leq r$},\\
     |                0& \text{otherwise}.
     |                \end{cases}
     |
     |      The triangular distribution is often used in ill-defined
     |      problems where the underlying distribution is not known, but
     |      some knowledge of the limits and mode exists. Often it is used
     |      in simulations.

     |  uniform(...)
     |      uniform(low=0.0, high=1.0, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from a uniform distribution.
     |
     |      Samples are uniformly distributed over the half-open interval
     |      ``[low, high)`` (includes low, but excludes high).  In other words,
     |      any value within the given interval is equally likely to be drawn
     |      by `uniform`.
     |
     |      .. note::
     |          New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.uniform`
     |          method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
     |          please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      low : float or array_like of floats, optional
     |          Lower boundary of the output interval.  All values generated will be
     |          greater than or equal to low.  The default value is 0.
     |      high : float or array_like of floats
     |          Upper boundary of the output interval.  All values generated will be
     |          less than or equal to high.  The high limit may be included in the
     |          returned array of floats due to floating-point rounding in the
     |          equation ``low + (high-low) * random_sample()``.  The default value
     |          is 1.0.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``low`` and ``high`` are both scalars.
     |          Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(low, high).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized uniform distribution.
     |
     |      See Also
     |      --------
     |      randint : Discrete uniform distribution, yielding integers.
     |      random_integers : Discrete uniform distribution over the closed

     |      random_sample : Floats uniformly distributed over ``[0, 1)``.
     |      random : Alias for `random_sample`.
     |      rand : Convenience function that accepts dimensions as input, e.g.,
     |             ``rand(2,2)`` would generate a 2-by-2 array of floats,
     |             uniformly distributed over ``[0, 1)``.
     |      random.Generator.uniform: which should be used for new code.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density function of the uniform distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: p(x) = \frac{1}{b - a}
     |
     |      anywhere within the interval ``[a, b)``, and zero elsewhere.
     |
     |      When ``high`` == ``low``, values of ``low`` will be returned.
     |      If ``high`` < ``low``, the results are officially undefined
     |      and may eventually raise an error, i.e. do not rely on this
     |      function to behave when passed arguments satisfying that
     |      inequality condition. The ``high`` limit may be included in the
     |      returned array of floats due to floating-point rounding in the
     |      equation ``low + (high-low) * random_sample()``. For example:
     |
     |      >>> x = np.float32(5*0.99999999)
     |      >>> x
     |      5.0
     |
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      Draw samples from the distribution:
     |
     |      >>> s = np.random.uniform(-1,0,1000)
     |
     |      All values are within the given interval:
     |
     |      >>> np.all(s >= -1)
     |      True
     |      >>> np.all(s < 0)
     |      True

     |      >>> plt.plot(bins, np.ones_like(bins), linewidth=2, color='r')
     |      >>> plt.show()
     |
     |  vonmises(...)
     |      vonmises(mu, kappa, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from a von Mises distribution.
     |
     |      Samples are drawn from a von Mises distribution with specified mode
     |      (mu) and dispersion (kappa), on the interval [-pi, pi].
     |
     |      The von Mises distribution (also known as the circular normal
     |      distribution) is a continuous probability distribution on the unit
     |      circle.  It may be thought of as the circular analogue of the normal
     |      distribution.
     |
     |      .. note::

     |          please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      mu : float or array_like of floats
     |          Mode ("center") of the distribution.
     |      kappa : float or array_like of floats
     |          Dispersion of the distribution, has to be >=0.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``mu`` and ``kappa`` are both scalars.
     |          Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(mu, kappa).size`` samples are drawn.

     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density for the von Mises distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: p(x) = \frac{e^{\kappa cos(x-\mu)}}{2\pi I_0(\kappa)},
     |
     |      where :math:`\mu` is the mode and :math:`\kappa` the dispersion,
     |      and :math:`I_0(\kappa)` is the modified Bessel function of order 0.
     |
     |      The von Mises is named for Richard Edler von Mises, who was born in
     |      Austria-Hungary, in what is now the Ukraine.  He fled to the United
     |      States in 1939 and became a professor at Harvard.  He worked in
     |      probability theory, aerodynamics, fluid mechanics, and philosophy of
     |      science.

     |  wald(...)
     |      wald(mean, scale, size=None)
     |
     |      Draw samples from a Wald, or inverse Gaussian, distribution.
     |
     |      As the scale approaches infinity, the distribution becomes more like a
     |      Gaussian. Some references claim that the Wald is an inverse Gaussian
     |      with mean equal to 1, but this is by no means universal.
     |
     |      The inverse Gaussian distribution was first studied in relationship to
     |      Brownian motion. In 1956 M.C.K. Tweedie used the name inverse Gaussian
     |      because there is an inverse relationship between the time to cover a
     |      unit distance and distance covered in unit time.
     |
     |      .. note::
     |          New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.wald`
     |          method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
     |          please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      mean : float or array_like of floats
     |          Distribution mean, must be > 0.
     |      scale : float or array_like of floats
     |          Scale parameter, must be > 0.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
     |          a single value is returned if ``mean`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
     |          Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(mean, scale).size`` samples are drawn.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray or scalar
     |          Drawn samples from the parameterized Wald distribution.
     |
     |      See Also
     |      --------
     |      random.Generator.wald: which should be used for new code.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density function for the Wald distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: P(x;mean,scale) = \sqrt{\frac{scale}{2\pi x^3}}e^
     |                                  \frac{-scale(x-mean)^2}{2\cdotp mean^2x}
     |
     |      As noted above the inverse Gaussian distribution first arise
     |      from attempts to model Brownian motion. It is also a
     |      competitor to the Weibull for use in reliability modeling and
     |      modeling stock returns and interest rate processes.

     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The Weibull (or Type III asymptotic extreme value distribution
     |      for smallest values, SEV Type III, or Rosin-Rammler
     |      distribution) is one of a class of Generalized Extreme Value
     |      (GEV) distributions used in modeling extreme value problems.
     |      This class includes the Gumbel and Frechet distributions.
     |
     |      The probability density for the Weibull distribution is
     |
     |      .. math:: p(x) = \frac{a}
     |                       {\lambda}(\frac{x}{\lambda})^{a-1}e^{-(x/\lambda)^a},
     |
     |      where :math:`a` is the shape and :math:`\lambda` the scale.
     |
     |      The function has its peak (the mode) at
     |      :math:`\lambda(\frac{a-1}{a})^{1/a}`.
     |
     |      When ``a = 1``, the Weibull distribution reduces to the exponential
     |      distribution.

     |
     |      Samples are drawn from a Zipf distribution with specified parameter
     |      `a` > 1.
     |
     |      The Zipf distribution (also known as the zeta distribution) is a

     |          Distribution parameter. Must be greater than 1.
     |      size : int or tuple of ints, optional
     |          Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
     |          ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),

     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The probability density for the Zipf distribution is

     |
     |      for integers :math:`k \geq 1`, where :math:`\zeta` is the Riemann Zeta
     |      function.
     |
     |      It is named for the American linguist George Kingsley Zipf, who noted
     |      that the frequency of any word in a sample of a language is inversely
     |      proportional to its rank in the frequency table.

     |  BitGenerator for Chris Doty-Humphrey's Small Fast Chaotic PRNG.
     |
     |  Parameters
     |  ----------
     |  seed : {None, int, array_like[ints], SeedSequence}, optional
     |      A seed to initialize the `BitGenerator`. If None, then fresh,
     |      unpredictable entropy will be pulled from the OS. If an ``int`` or
     |      ``array_like[ints]`` is passed, then it will be passed to
     |      `SeedSequence` to derive the initial `BitGenerator` state. One may also
     |      pass in a `SeedSequence` instance.
     |
     |  Notes
     |  -----
     |  ``SFC64`` is a 256-bit implementation of Chris Doty-Humphrey's Small Fast
     |  Chaotic PRNG ([1]_). ``SFC64`` has a few different cycles that one might be
     |  on, depending on the seed; the expected period will be about
     |  :math:`2^{255}` ([2]_). ``SFC64`` incorporates a 64-bit counter which means
     |  that the absolute minimum cycle length is :math:`2^{64}` and that distinct
     |  seeds will not run into each other for at least :math:`2^{64}` iterations.
     |
     |  ``SFC64`` provides a capsule containing function pointers that produce
     |  doubles, and unsigned 32 and 64- bit integers. These are not
     |  directly consumable in Python and must be consumed by a ``Generator``
     |  or similar object that supports low-level access.
     |
     |  **State and Seeding**
     |
     |  The ``SFC64`` state vector consists of 4 unsigned 64-bit values. The last
     |  is a 64-bit counter that increments by 1 each iteration.
     |
     |  The input seed is processed by `SeedSequence` to generate the first
     |  3 values, then the ``SFC64`` algorithm is iterated a small number of times
     |  to mix.
     |
     |  **Compatibility Guarantee**
     |
     |  ``SFC64`` makes a guarantee that a fixed seed will always produce the same
     |  random integer stream.

     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      This method directly exposes the raw underlying pseudo-random
     |      number generator. All values are returned as unsigned 64-bit
     |      values irrespective of the number of bits produced by the PRNG.
     |
     |      See the class docstring for the number of bits returned.

     |
     |      See :ref:`seedsequence-spawn` for additional notes on spawning
     |      children.  Some bit generators also implement ``jumped``
     |      as a different approach for creating independent streams.

     |
     |      .. versionadded:: 1.25.0
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      seed_seq : ISeedSequence
     |          The SeedSequence object used to initialize the BitGenerator.
     |          This is normally a `np.random.SeedSequence` instance.

    class SeedSequence(builtins.object)
     |  SeedSequence(entropy=None, *, spawn_key=(), pool_size=4)
     |
     |  SeedSequence mixes sources of entropy in a reproducible way to set the
     |  initial state for independent and very probably non-overlapping
     |  BitGenerators.
     |
     |  Once the SeedSequence is instantiated, you can call the `generate_state`
     |  method to get an appropriately sized seed. Calling `spawn(n) <spawn>` will
     |  create ``n`` SeedSequences that can be used to seed independent
     |  BitGenerators, i.e. for different threads.
     |
     |  Parameters
     |  ----------
     |  entropy : {None, int, sequence[int]}, optional
     |      The entropy for creating a `SeedSequence`.
     |      All integer values must be non-negative.
     |  spawn_key : {(), sequence[int]}, optional
     |      An additional source of entropy based on the position of this
     |      `SeedSequence` in the tree of such objects created with the
     |      `SeedSequence.spawn` method. Typically, only `SeedSequence.spawn` will
     |      set this, and users will not.
     |  pool_size : {int}, optional
     |      Size of the pooled entropy to store. Default is 4 to give a 128-bit
     |      entropy pool. 8 (for 256 bits) is another reasonable choice if working
     |      with larger PRNGs, but there is very little to be gained by selecting
     |      another value.
     |  n_children_spawned : {int}, optional
     |      The number of children already spawned. Only pass this if
     |      reconstructing a `SeedSequence` from a serialized form.
     |
     |  Notes
     |  -----
     |
     |  Best practice for achieving reproducible bit streams is to use
     |  the default ``None`` for the initial entropy, and then use
     |  `SeedSequence.entropy` to log/pickle the `entropy` for reproducibility:
     |
     |  >>> sq1 = np.random.SeedSequence()
     |  >>> sq1.entropy
     |  243799254704924441050048792905230269161  # random
     |  >>> sq2 = np.random.SeedSequence(sq1.entropy)
     |  >>> np.all(sq1.generate_state(10) == sq2.generate_state(10))
     |  True

     |
     |      A BitGenerator should call this method in its constructor with

     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      n_words : int
     |      dtype : np.uint32 or np.uint64, optional
     |          The size of each word. This should only be either `uint32` or
     |          `uint64`. Strings (`'uint32'`, `'uint64'`) are fine. Note that
     |          requesting `uint64` will draw twice as many bits as `uint32` for
     |          the same `n_words`. This is a convenience for `BitGenerator`s that
     |          express their states as `uint64` arrays.

FUNCTIONS
    beta(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        beta(a, b, size=None)

        Draw samples from a Beta distribution.

        The Beta distribution is a special case of the Dirichlet distribution,
        and is related to the Gamma distribution.  It has the probability
        distribution function

        .. math:: f(x; a,b) = \frac{1}{B(\alpha, \beta)} x^{\alpha - 1}
                                                         (1 - x)^{\beta - 1},

        where the normalization, B, is the beta function,

        .. math:: B(\alpha, \beta) = \int_0^1 t^{\alpha - 1}
                                     (1 - t)^{\beta - 1} dt.

        It is often seen in Bayesian inference and order statistics.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.beta`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.


        Parameters
        ----------
        a : float or array_like of floats
            Alpha, positive (>0).
        b : float or array_like of floats
            Beta, positive (>0).
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``a`` and ``b`` are both scalars.
            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(a, b).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized beta distribution.

        See Also
        --------
        random.Generator.beta: which should be used for new code.

    binomial(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        binomial(n, p, size=None)

        Draw samples from a binomial distribution.

        Samples are drawn from a binomial distribution with specified
        parameters, n trials and p probability of success where
        n an integer >= 0 and p is in the interval [0,1]. (n may be
        input as a float, but it is truncated to an integer in use)

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.binomial`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int or array_like of ints
            Parameter of the distribution, >= 0. Floats are also accepted,
            but they will be truncated to integers.
        p : float or array_like of floats
            Parameter of the distribution, >= 0 and <=1.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``n`` and ``p`` are both scalars.
            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(n, p).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized binomial distribution, where
            each sample is equal to the number of successes over the n trials.

        See Also
        --------
        scipy.stats.binom : probability density function, distribution or
            cumulative density function, etc.
        random.Generator.binomial: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the binomial distribution is

        .. math:: P(N) = \binom{n}{N}p^N(1-p)^{n-N},

        where :math:`n` is the number of trials, :math:`p` is the probability
        of success, and :math:`N` is the number of successes.

        When estimating the standard error of a proportion in a population by
        using a random sample, the normal distribution works well unless the
        product p*n <=5, where p = population proportion estimate, and n =
        number of samples, in which case the binomial distribution is used
        instead. For example, a sample of 15 people shows 4 who are left
        handed, and 11 who are right handed. Then p = 4/15 = 27%. 0.27*15 = 4,
        so the binomial distribution should be used in this case.

        wells, each with an estimated probability of success of 0.1. All nine
        wells fail. What is the probability of that happening?

        Let's do 20,000 trials of the model, and count the number that

    bytes(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        bytes(length)

        Return random bytes.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.bytes`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;

        Parameters
        ----------
        length : int
            Number of random bytes.

        Returns
        -------
        out : bytes
            String of length `length`.

    chisquare(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        chisquare(df, size=None)

        Draw samples from a chi-square distribution.

        When `df` independent random variables, each with standard normal
        distributions (mean 0, variance 1), are squared and summed, the
        resulting distribution is chi-square (see Notes).  This distribution
        is often used in hypothesis testing.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.chisquare`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        df : float or array_like of floats
             Number of degrees of freedom, must be > 0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``df`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
            ``np.array(df).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized chi-square distribution.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            When `df` <= 0 or when an inappropriate `size` (e.g. ``size=-1``)
            is given.

        Notes
        -----
        The variable obtained by summing the squares of `df` independent,
        standard normally distributed random variables:

        .. math:: Q = \sum_{i=0}^{\mathtt{df}} X^2_i

        is chi-square distributed, denoted

        .. math:: Q \sim \chi^2_k.

        The probability density function of the chi-squared distribution is

                         x^{k/2 - 1} e^{-x/2},

        where :math:`\Gamma` is the gamma function,

        .. math:: \Gamma(x) = \int_0^{-\infty} t^{x - 1} e^{-t} dt.

    choice(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        choice(a, size=None, replace=True, p=None)

        Generates a random sample from a given 1-D array

        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.choice`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        a : 1-D array-like or int
            If an ndarray, a random sample is generated from its elements.
            If an int, the random sample is generated as if it were ``np.arange(a)``
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        replace : boolean, optional
            Whether the sample is with or without replacement. Default is True,
            meaning that a value of ``a`` can be selected multiple times.
        p : 1-D array-like, optional
            The probabilities associated with each entry in a.
            If not given, the sample assumes a uniform distribution over all
            entries in ``a``.

        Returns
        -------
        samples : single item or ndarray
            The generated random samples

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If a is an int and less than zero, if a or p are not 1-dimensional,
            if a is an array-like of size 0, if p is not a vector of
            probabilities, if a and p have different lengths, or if
            replace=False and the sample size is greater than the population
            size

        random.Generator.choice: which should be used in new code

        Notes
        -----
        Setting user-specified probabilities through ``p`` uses a more general but less
        efficient sampler than the default. The general sampler produces a different sample
        than the optimized sampler even if each element of ``p`` is 1 / len(a).

        Sampling random rows from a 2-D array is not possible with this function,
        but is possible with `Generator.choice` through its ``axis`` keyword.

        Examples
        --------
        Generate a uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size 3:

        >>> np.random.choice(5, 3)
        array([0, 3, 4]) # random
        >>> #This is equivalent to np.random.randint(0,5,3)

        Generate a non-uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size 3:

        >>> np.random.choice(5, 3, p=[0.1, 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0])
        array([3, 3, 0]) # random

        Generate a uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size 3 without
        replacement:

        >>> np.random.choice(5, 3, replace=False)
        array([3,1,0]) # random
        >>> #This is equivalent to np.random.permutation(np.arange(5))[:3]

        Generate a non-uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size
        3 without replacement:

        >>> np.random.choice(5, 3, replace=False, p=[0.1, 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0])
        array([2, 3, 0]) # random

        Any of the above can be repeated with an arbitrary array-like
        instead of just integers. For instance:

        >>> aa_milne_arr = ['pooh', 'rabbit', 'piglet', 'Christopher']
        >>> np.random.choice(aa_milne_arr, 5, p=[0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 0.3])
        array(['pooh', 'pooh', 'pooh', 'Christopher', 'piglet'], # random
              dtype='<U11')

    default_rng(...)
        default_rng(seed=None)
        Construct a new Generator with the default BitGenerator (PCG64).

            Parameters
            ----------
            seed : {None, int, array_like[ints], SeedSequence, BitGenerator, Generator}, optional
                A seed to initialize the `BitGenerator`. If None, then fresh,
                unpredictable entropy will be pulled from the OS. If an ``int`` or
                ``array_like[ints]`` is passed, then it will be passed to
                `SeedSequence` to derive the initial `BitGenerator` state. One may also
                pass in a `SeedSequence` instance.
                Additionally, when passed a `BitGenerator`, it will be wrapped by
                `Generator`. If passed a `Generator`, it will be returned unaltered.

            Returns
            -------
            Generator
                The initialized generator object.

            Notes
            -----
            If ``seed`` is not a `BitGenerator` or a `Generator`, a new `BitGenerator`
            is instantiated. This function does not manage a default global instance.

            See :ref:`seeding_and_entropy` for more information about seeding.

            Examples
            --------
            ``default_rng`` is the recommended constructor for the random number class
            ``Generator``. Here are several ways we can construct a random
            number generator using ``default_rng`` and the ``Generator`` class.

            Here we use ``default_rng`` to generate a random float:

            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> rng = np.random.default_rng(12345)
            >>> print(rng)
            Generator(PCG64)
            >>> rfloat = rng.random()
            >>> rfloat
            0.22733602246716966
            >>> type(rfloat)
            <class 'float'>

            Here we use ``default_rng`` to generate 3 random integers between 0
            (inclusive) and 10 (exclusive):

            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> rng = np.random.default_rng(12345)
            >>> rints = rng.integers(low=0, high=10, size=3)
            >>> rints
            array([6, 2, 7])
            >>> type(rints[0])
            <class 'numpy.int64'>

            Here we specify a seed so that we have reproducible results:

            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> rng = np.random.default_rng(seed=42)
            >>> print(rng)
            Generator(PCG64)
            >>> arr1 = rng.random((3, 3))
            >>> arr1
            array([[0.77395605, 0.43887844, 0.85859792],
                   [0.69736803, 0.09417735, 0.97562235],
                   [0.7611397 , 0.78606431, 0.12811363]])

            If we exit and restart our Python interpreter, we'll see that we
            generate the same random numbers again:

            >>> import numpy as np
            >>> rng = np.random.default_rng(seed=42)
            >>> arr2 = rng.random((3, 3))
            >>> arr2
            array([[0.77395605, 0.43887844, 0.85859792],
                   [0.69736803, 0.09417735, 0.97562235],
                   [0.7611397 , 0.78606431, 0.12811363]])

    dirichlet(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        dirichlet(alpha, size=None)

        Draw samples from the Dirichlet distribution.

        Draw `size` samples of dimension k from a Dirichlet distribution. A
        Dirichlet-distributed random variable can be seen as a multivariate
        generalization of a Beta distribution. The Dirichlet distribution
        is a conjugate prior of a multinomial distribution in Bayesian
        inference.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.dirichlet`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        alpha : sequence of floats, length k
            Parameter of the distribution (length ``k`` for sample of
            length ``k``).
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            vector of length ``k`` is returned.

        Returns
        -------
        samples : ndarray,
            The drawn samples, of shape ``(size, k)``.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If any value in ``alpha`` is less than or equal to zero

        See Also
        --------
        random.Generator.dirichlet: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The Dirichlet distribution is a distribution over vectors
        :math:`x` that fulfil the conditions :math:`x_i>0` and
        :math:`\sum_{i=1}^k x_i = 1`.

        The probability density function :math:`p` of a
        Dirichlet-distributed random vector :math:`X` is
        proportional to

        .. math:: p(x) \propto \prod_{i=1}^{k}{x^{\alpha_i-1}_i},

        where :math:`\alpha` is a vector containing the positive
        concentration parameters.

        The method uses the following property for computation: let :math:`Y`
        be a random vector which has components that follow a standard gamma
        distribution, then :math:`X = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^k{Y_i}} Y`
        is Dirichlet-distributed

        Examples

        Taking an example cited in Wikipedia, this distribution can be used if
        one wanted to cut strings (each of initial length 1.0) into K pieces
        with different lengths, where each piece had, on average, a designated
        average length, but allowing some variation in the relative sizes of
        the pieces.

    exponential(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        exponential(scale=1.0, size=None)

        Draw samples from an exponential distribution.

        Its probability density function is

        .. math:: f(x; \frac{1}{\beta}) = \frac{1}{\beta} \exp(-\frac{x}{\beta}),

        for ``x > 0`` and 0 elsewhere. :math:`\beta` is the scale parameter,
        which is the inverse of the rate parameter :math:`\lambda = 1/\beta`.
        The rate parameter is an alternative, widely used parameterization
        of the exponential distribution [3]_.

        The exponential distribution is a continuous analogue of the
        geometric distribution.  It describes many common situations, such as
        the size of raindrops measured over many rainstorms [1]_, or the time
        between page requests to Wikipedia [2]_.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.exponential`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        scale : float or array_like of floats
            The scale parameter, :math:`\beta = 1/\lambda`. Must be
            non-negative.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``scale`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
            ``np.array(scale).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized exponential distribution.

        Examples
        --------
        A real world example: Assume a company has 10000 customer support
        agents and the average time between customer calls is 4 minutes.

        >>> n = 10000
        >>> time_between_calls = np.random.default_rng().exponential(scale=4, size=n)

        What is the probability that a customer will call in the next
        4 to 5 minutes?

        >>> x = ((time_between_calls < 5).sum())/n
        >>> y = ((time_between_calls < 4).sum())/n
        >>> x-y
        0.08 # may vary

    f(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        f(dfnum, dfden, size=None)

        Draw samples from an F distribution.

        Samples are drawn from an F distribution with specified parameters,
        `dfnum` (degrees of freedom in numerator) and `dfden` (degrees of
        freedom in denominator), where both parameters must be greater than
        zero.

        The random variate of the F distribution (also known as the
        Fisher distribution) is a continuous probability distribution
        that arises in ANOVA tests, and is the ratio of two chi-square
        variates.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.f`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dfnum : float or array_like of floats
            Degrees of freedom in numerator, must be > 0.
        dfden : float or array_like of float
            Degrees of freedom in denominator, must be > 0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``dfnum`` and ``dfden`` are both scalars.
            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(dfnum, dfden).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized Fisher distribution.

        See Also
        --------
        scipy.stats.f : probability density function, distribution or
            cumulative density function, etc.
        random.Generator.f: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The F statistic is used to compare in-group variances to between-group
        variances. Calculating the distribution depends on the sampling, and
        so it is a function of the respective degrees of freedom in the
        problem.  The variable `dfnum` is the number of samples minus one, the
        between-groups degrees of freedom, while `dfden` is the within-groups
        degrees of freedom, the sum of the number of samples in each group
        minus the number of groups.

        .. [2] Wikipedia, "F-distribution",
               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-distribution

        Examples
        --------
        An example from Glantz[1], pp 47-40:

        Two groups, children of diabetics (25 people) and children from people
        without diabetes (25 controls). Fasting blood glucose was measured,
        case group had a mean value of 86.1, controls had a mean value of
        82.2. Standard deviations were 2.09 and 2.49 respectively. Are these
        data consistent with the null hypothesis that the parents diabetic
        status does not affect their children's blood glucose levels?
        Calculating the F statistic from the data gives a value of 36.01.

        Draw samples from the distribution:

        >>> dfnum = 1. # between group degrees of freedom
        >>> dfden = 48. # within groups degrees of freedom
        >>> s = np.random.f(dfnum, dfden, 1000)

        The lower bound for the top 1% of the samples is :

        >>> np.sort(s)[-10]
        7.61988120985 # random

        So there is about a 1% chance that the F statistic will exceed 7.62,
        the measured value is 36, so the null hypothesis is rejected at the 1%
        level.

    gamma(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        gamma(shape, scale=1.0, size=None)

        Draw samples from a Gamma distribution.

        Samples are drawn from a Gamma distribution with specified parameters,
        `shape` (sometimes designated "k") and `scale` (sometimes designated
        "theta"), where both parameters are > 0.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.gamma`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        shape : float or array_like of floats
            The shape of the gamma distribution. Must be non-negative.
        scale : float or array_like of floats, optional
            The scale of the gamma distribution. Must be non-negative.
            Default is equal to 1.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``shape`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(shape, scale).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized gamma distribution.

        See Also
        --------
        scipy.stats.gamma : probability density function, distribution or
            cumulative density function, etc.
        random.Generator.gamma: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Gamma distribution is

        .. math:: p(x) = x^{k-1}\frac{e^{-x/\theta}}{\theta^k\Gamma(k)},

        where :math:`k` is the shape and :math:`\theta` the scale,
        and :math:`\Gamma` is the Gamma function.

        The Gamma distribution is often used to model the times to failure of
        electronic components, and arises naturally in processes for which the
        waiting times between Poisson distributed events are relevant.

        >>> plt.show()

    geometric(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        geometric(p, size=None)

        Draw samples from the geometric distribution.

        Bernoulli trials are experiments with one of two outcomes:
        success or failure (an example of such an experiment is flipping
        a coin).  The geometric distribution models the number of trials
        that must be run in order to achieve success.  It is therefore
        supported on the positive integers, ``k = 1, 2, ...``.

        The probability mass function of the geometric distribution is

        .. math:: f(k) = (1 - p)^{k - 1} p

        where `p` is the probability of success of an individual trial.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.geometric`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        p : float or array_like of floats
            The probability of success of an individual trial.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``p`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
            ``np.array(p).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar

    get_state(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        get_state(legacy=True)

        Return a tuple representing the internal state of the generator.

        For more details, see `set_state`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        legacy : bool, optional
            Flag indicating to return a legacy tuple state when the BitGenerator
            is MT19937, instead of a dict. Raises ValueError if the underlying
            bit generator is not an instance of MT19937.

        Returns
        -------
        out : {tuple(str, ndarray of 624 uints, int, int, float), dict}
            If legacy is True, the returned tuple has the following items:

            1. the string 'MT19937'.
            2. a 1-D array of 624 unsigned integer keys.
            3. an integer ``pos``.
            4. an integer ``has_gauss``.
            5. a float ``cached_gaussian``.

            If `legacy` is False, or the BitGenerator is not MT19937, then
            state is returned as a dictionary.

        -----
        `set_state` and `get_state` are not needed to work with any of the
        random distributions in NumPy. If the internal state is manually altered,
        the user should know exactly what he/she is doing.

    gumbel(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        gumbel(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=None)

        Draw samples from a Gumbel distribution.

        Draw samples from a Gumbel distribution with specified location and
        scale.  For more information on the Gumbel distribution, see
        Notes and References below.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.gumbel`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        loc : float or array_like of floats, optional
            The location of the mode of the distribution. Default is 0.
        scale : float or array_like of floats, optional
            The scale parameter of the distribution. Default is 1. Must be non-
            negative.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``loc`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(loc, scale).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized Gumbel distribution.

        Notes
        -----
        The Gumbel (or Smallest Extreme Value (SEV) or the Smallest Extreme
        Value Type I) distribution is one of a class of Generalized Extreme
        Value (GEV) distributions used in modeling extreme value problems.
        The Gumbel is a special case of the Extreme Value Type I distribution
        for maximums from distributions with "exponential-like" tails.

        The probability density for the Gumbel distribution is

        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{e^{-(x - \mu)/ \beta}}{\beta} e^{ -e^{-(x - \mu)/
                  \beta}},

        where :math:`\mu` is the mode, a location parameter, and
        :math:`\beta` is the scale parameter.

        The Gumbel (named for German mathematician Emil Julius Gumbel) was used
        very early in the hydrology literature, for modeling the occurrence of
        flood events. It is also used for modeling maximum wind speed and
        rainfall rates.  It is a "fat-tailed" distribution - the probability of
        an event in the tail of the distribution is larger than if one used a
        Gaussian, hence the surprisingly frequent occurrence of 100-year
        floods. Floods were initially modeled as a Gaussian process, which
        underestimated the frequency of extreme events.

        It is one of a class of extreme value distributions, the Generalized
        Extreme Value (GEV) distributions, which also includes the Weibull and
        Frechet.

        The function has a mean of :math:`\mu + 0.57721\beta` and a variance
        of :math:`\frac{\pi^2}{6}\beta^2`.

    hypergeometric(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        hypergeometric(ngood, nbad, nsample, size=None)

        Draw samples from a Hypergeometric distribution.

        Samples are drawn from a hypergeometric distribution with specified
        parameters, `ngood` (ways to make a good selection), `nbad` (ways to make
        a bad selection), and `nsample` (number of items sampled, which is less
        than or equal to the sum ``ngood + nbad``).

        .. note::
            New code should use the
            `~numpy.random.Generator.hypergeometric`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        ngood : int or array_like of ints
            Number of ways to make a good selection.  Must be nonnegative.
        nbad : int or array_like of ints
            Number of ways to make a bad selection.  Must be nonnegative.
        nsample : int or array_like of ints
            Number of items sampled.  Must be at least 1 and at most
            ``ngood + nbad``.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if `ngood`, `nbad`, and `nsample`
            are all scalars.  Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(ngood, nbad, nsample).size``
            samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized hypergeometric distribution. Each
            sample is the number of good items within a randomly selected subset of
            size `nsample` taken from a set of `ngood` good items and `nbad` bad items.

        See Also
        --------
        scipy.stats.hypergeom : probability density function, distribution or
            cumulative density function, etc.
        random.Generator.hypergeometric: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Hypergeometric distribution is

        .. math:: P(x) = \frac{\binom{g}{x}\binom{b}{n-x}}{\binom{g+b}{n}},

        where :math:`0 \le x \le n` and :math:`n-b \le x \le g`

        for P(x) the probability of ``x`` good results in the drawn sample,
        g = `ngood`, b = `nbad`, and n = `nsample`.

        Consider an urn with black and white marbles in it, `ngood` of them
        are black and `nbad` are white. If you draw `nsample` balls without
        replacement, then the hypergeometric distribution describes the
        distribution of black balls in the drawn sample.

        Note that this distribution is very similar to the binomial
        distribution, except that in this case, samples are drawn without
        replacement, whereas in the Binomial case samples are drawn with
        replacement (or the sample space is infinite). As the sample space
        becomes large, this distribution approaches the binomial.

        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples from the distribution:

        >>> ngood, nbad, nsamp = 100, 2, 10
        # number of good, number of bad, and number of samples
        >>> s = np.random.hypergeometric(ngood, nbad, nsamp, 1000)
        >>> from matplotlib.pyplot import hist
        >>> hist(s)
        #   note that it is very unlikely to grab both bad items

        Suppose you have an urn with 15 white and 15 black marbles.
        If you pull 15 marbles at random, how likely is it that
        12 or more of them are one color?

        >>> s = np.random.hypergeometric(15, 15, 15, 100000)
        >>> sum(s>=12)/100000. + sum(s<=3)/100000.
        #   answer = 0.003 ... pretty unlikely!

    laplace(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        laplace(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=None)

        Draw samples from the Laplace or double exponential distribution with
        specified location (or mean) and scale (decay).

        The Laplace distribution is similar to the Gaussian/normal distribution,
        but is sharper at the peak and has fatter tails. It represents the
        difference between two independent, identically distributed exponential
        random variables.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.laplace`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        loc : float or array_like of floats, optional
            The position, :math:`\mu`, of the distribution peak. Default is 0.
        scale : float or array_like of floats, optional
            :math:`\lambda`, the exponential decay. Default is 1. Must be non-
            negative.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``loc`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(loc, scale).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized Laplace distribution.

        See Also
        --------
        random.Generator.laplace: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        It has the probability density function

        .. math:: f(x; \mu, \lambda) = \frac{1}{2\lambda}
                                       \exp\left(-\frac{|x - \mu|}{\lambda}\right).

        The first law of Laplace, from 1774, states that the frequency
        of an error can be expressed as an exponential function of the
        absolute magnitude of the error, which leads to the Laplace
        distribution. For many problems in economics and health
        sciences, this distribution seems to model the data better
        than the standard Gaussian distribution.

        Draw samples from a logistic distribution.

        Samples are drawn from a logistic distribution with specified
        parameters, loc (location or mean, also median), and scale (>0).

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.logistic`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Logistic distribution is

        where :math:`\mu` = location and :math:`s` = scale.

        The Logistic distribution is used in Extreme Value problems where it
        can act as a mixture of Gumbel distributions, in Epidemiology, and by
        the World Chess Federation (FIDE) where it is used in the Elo ranking
        system, assuming the performance of each player is a logistically
        distributed random variable.

        Draw samples from a log-normal distribution with specified mean,
        standard deviation, and array shape.  Note that the mean and standard

        A variable `x` has a log-normal distribution if `log(x)` is normally
        distributed.  The probability density function for the log-normal
        distribution is:

        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma x \sqrt{2\pi}}
                         e^{(-\frac{(ln(x)-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2})}

        where :math:`\mu` is the mean and :math:`\sigma` is the standard
        deviation of the normally distributed logarithm of the variable.
        A log-normal distribution results if a random variable is the *product*
        of a large number of independent, identically-distributed variables in
        the same way that a normal distribution results if the variable is the
        *sum* of a large number of independent, identically-distributed
        variables.

        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples from the distribution:

        >>> mu, sigma = 3., 1. # mean and standard deviation
        >>> s = np.random.lognormal(mu, sigma, 1000)

        Display the histogram of the samples, along with
        the probability density function:

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s, 100, density=True, align='mid')

        >>> x = np.linspace(min(bins), max(bins), 10000)
        >>> pdf = (np.exp(-(np.log(x) - mu)**2 / (2 * sigma**2))
        ...        / (x * sigma * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)))

        >>> plt.plot(x, pdf, linewidth=2, color='r')
        >>> plt.axis('tight')
        >>> plt.show()

        Demonstrate that taking the products of random samples from a uniform
        distribution can be fit well by a log-normal probability density
        function.

        >>> # Generate a thousand samples: each is the product of 100 random
        >>> # values, drawn from a normal distribution.
        >>> b = []
        >>> for i in range(1000):
        ...    a = 10. + np.random.standard_normal(100)
        ...    b.append(np.prod(a))

        >>> b = np.array(b) / np.min(b) # scale values to be positive
        >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(b, 100, density=True, align='mid')
        >>> sigma = np.std(np.log(b))
        >>> mu = np.mean(np.log(b))

        >>> x = np.linspace(min(bins), max(bins), 10000)
        >>> pdf = (np.exp(-(np.log(x) - mu)**2 / (2 * sigma**2))
        ...        / (x * sigma * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)))

        >>> plt.plot(x, pdf, color='r', linewidth=2)
        >>> plt.show()

    logseries(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        logseries(p, size=None)

        Draw samples from a logarithmic series distribution.

        Samples are drawn from a log series distribution with specified
        shape parameter, 0 <= ``p`` < 1.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.logseries`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        p : float or array_like of floats
            Shape parameter for the distribution.  Must be in the range [0, 1).
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``p`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
            ``np.array(p).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized logarithmic series distribution.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Log Series distribution is

        .. math:: P(k) = \frac{-p^k}{k \ln(1-p)},

        where p = probability.

        The log series distribution is frequently used to represent species
        richness and occurrence, first proposed by Fisher, Corbet, and
        Williams in 1943 [2].  It may also be used to model the numbers of
        occupants seen in cars [3].

        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples from the distribution:

        >>> a = .6
        >>> s = np.random.logseries(a, 10000)
        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s)

        ...     return -p**k/(k*np.log(1-p))
        >>> plt.plot(bins, logseries(bins, a)*count.max()/
        ...          logseries(bins, a).max(), 'r')
        >>> plt.show()

    multinomial(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        multinomial(n, pvals, size=None)

        Draw samples from a multinomial distribution.

        The multinomial distribution is a multivariate generalization of the
        binomial distribution.  Take an experiment with one of ``p``
        possible outcomes.  An example of such an experiment is throwing a dice,
        where the outcome can be 1 through 6.  Each sample drawn from the
        distribution represents `n` such experiments.  Its values,
        ``X_i = [X_0, X_1, ..., X_p]``, represent the number of times the
        outcome was ``i``.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.multinomial`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int
            Number of experiments.
        pvals : sequence of floats, length p
            Probabilities of each of the ``p`` different outcomes.  These
            must sum to 1 (however, the last element is always assumed to
            account for the remaining probability, as long as
            ``sum(pvals[:-1]) <= 1)``.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray
            The drawn samples, of shape *size*, if that was provided.  If not,
            the shape is ``(N,)``.

            In other words, each entry ``out[i,j,...,:]`` is an N-dimensional
            value drawn from the distribution.

        See Also
        --------
        random.Generator.multinomial: which should be used for new code.

        Examples
        --------
        Throw a dice 20 times:

        >>> np.random.multinomial(20, [1/6.]*6, size=1)
        array([[4, 1, 7, 5, 2, 1]]) # random

        It landed 4 times on 1, once on 2, etc.

        Now, throw the dice 20 times, and 20 times again:

        >>> np.random.multinomial(20, [1/6.]*6, size=2)
        array([[3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3], # random
               [2, 4, 3, 4, 0, 7]])

        For the first run, we threw 3 times 1, 4 times 2, etc.  For the second,
        we threw 2 times 1, 4 times 2, etc.

        A loaded die is more likely to land on number 6:

        >>> np.random.multinomial(100, [1/7.]*5 + [2/7.])
        array([11, 16, 14, 17, 16, 26]) # random

        The probability inputs should be normalized. As an implementation
        detail, the value of the last entry is ignored and assumed to take
        up any leftover probability mass, but this should not be relied on.
        A biased coin which has twice as much weight on one side as on the
        other should be sampled like so:

        >>> np.random.multinomial(100, [1.0 / 3, 2.0 / 3])  # RIGHT
        array([38, 62]) # random

        not like:

        >>> np.random.multinomial(100, [1.0, 2.0])  # WRONG
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ValueError: pvals < 0, pvals > 1 or pvals contains NaNs

    multivariate_normal(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        multivariate_normal(mean, cov, size=None, check_valid='warn', tol=1e-8)

        Draw random samples from a multivariate normal distribution.

        The multivariate normal, multinormal or Gaussian distribution is a
        generalization of the one-dimensional normal distribution to higher
        dimensions.  Such a distribution is specified by its mean and
        covariance matrix.  These parameters are analogous to the mean
        (average or "center") and variance (standard deviation, or "width,"
        squared) of the one-dimensional normal distribution.

        .. note::
            New code should use the
            `~numpy.random.Generator.multivariate_normal`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mean : 1-D array_like, of length N
            Mean of the N-dimensional distribution.
        cov : 2-D array_like, of shape (N, N)
            Covariance matrix of the distribution. It must be symmetric and
            positive-semidefinite for proper sampling.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Given a shape of, for example, ``(m,n,k)``, ``m*n*k`` samples are
            generated, and packed in an `m`-by-`n`-by-`k` arrangement.  Because
            each sample is `N`-dimensional, the output shape is ``(m,n,k,N)``.
            If no shape is specified, a single (`N`-D) sample is returned.
        check_valid : { 'warn', 'raise', 'ignore' }, optional
            Behavior when the covariance matrix is not positive semidefinite.
        tol : float, optional
            Tolerance when checking the singular values in covariance matrix.
            cov is cast to double before the check.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray
            The drawn samples, of shape *size*, if that was provided.  If not,
            the shape is ``(N,)``.

            In other words, each entry ``out[i,j,...,:]`` is an N-dimensional
            value drawn from the distribution.

        See Also
        --------
        random.Generator.multivariate_normal: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The mean is a coordinate in N-dimensional space, which represents the
        location where samples are most likely to be generated.  This is
        analogous to the peak of the bell curve for the one-dimensional or
        univariate normal distribution.

        Covariance indicates the level to which two variables vary together.
        From the multivariate normal distribution, we draw N-dimensional
        samples, :math:`X = [x_1, x_2, ... x_N]`.  The covariance matrix
        element :math:`C_{ij}` is the covariance of :math:`x_i` and :math:`x_j`.
        The element :math:`C_{ii}` is the variance of :math:`x_i` (i.e. its
        "spread").

        Instead of specifying the full covariance matrix, popular
        approximations include:

          - Spherical covariance (`cov` is a multiple of the identity matrix)
          - Diagonal covariance (`cov` has non-negative elements, and only on
            the diagonal)

        This geometrical property can be seen in two dimensions by plotting
        generated data-points:

        >>> mean = [0, 0]
        >>> cov = [[1, 0], [0, 100]]  # diagonal covariance

        Diagonal covariance means that points are oriented along x or y-axis:

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> x, y = np.random.multivariate_normal(mean, cov, 5000).T
        >>> plt.plot(x, y, 'x')
        >>> plt.axis('equal')
        >>> plt.show()

        Note that the covariance matrix must be positive semidefinite (a.k.a.
        nonnegative-definite). Otherwise, the behavior of this method is
        undefined and backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.

        >>> mean = (1, 2)
        >>> cov = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]

        Here we generate 800 samples from the bivariate normal distribution
        with mean [0, 0] and covariance matrix [[6, -3], [-3, 3.5]].  The
        expected variances of the first and second components of the sample
        are 6 and 3.5, respectively, and the expected correlation
        coefficient is -3/sqrt(6*3.5) ≈ -0.65465.

        >>> cov = np.array([[6, -3], [-3, 3.5]])
        >>> pts = np.random.multivariate_normal([0, 0], cov, size=800)

        Check that the mean, covariance, and correlation coefficient of the
        sample are close to the expected values:

        >>> pts.mean(axis=0)
        array([ 0.0326911 , -0.01280782])  # may vary
        >>> np.cov(pts.T)
        array([[ 5.96202397, -2.85602287],
               [-2.85602287,  3.47613949]])  # may vary
        >>> np.corrcoef(pts.T)[0, 1]
        -0.6273591314603949  # may vary

        We can visualize this data with a scatter plot.  The orientation
        of the point cloud illustrates the negative correlation of the
        components of this sample.

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> plt.plot(pts[:, 0], pts[:, 1], '.', alpha=0.5)

    negative_binomial(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        negative_binomial(n, p, size=None)

        Draw samples from a negative binomial distribution.

        Samples are drawn from a negative binomial distribution with specified
        parameters, `n` successes and `p` probability of success where `n`
        is > 0 and `p` is in the interval [0, 1].

        .. note::
            New code should use the
            `~numpy.random.Generator.negative_binomial`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n : float or array_like of floats
            Parameter of the distribution, > 0.
        p : float or array_like of floats
            Parameter of the distribution, >= 0 and <=1.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``n`` and ``p`` are both scalars.
            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(n, p).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized negative binomial distribution,
            where each sample is equal to N, the number of failures that
            occurred before a total of n successes was reached.

        See Also
        --------
        random.Generator.negative_binomial: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability mass function of the negative binomial distribution is

        .. math:: P(N;n,p) = \frac{\Gamma(N+n)}{N!\Gamma(n)}p^{n}(1-p)^{N},

        where :math:`n` is the number of successes, :math:`p` is the
        probability of success, :math:`N+n` is the number of trials, and
        :math:`\Gamma` is the gamma function. When :math:`n` is an integer,
        :math:`\frac{\Gamma(N+n)}{N!\Gamma(n)} = \binom{N+n-1}{N}`, which is
        the more common form of this term in the pmf. The negative
        binomial distribution gives the probability of N failures given n
        successes, with a success on the last trial.

        If one throws a die repeatedly until the third time a "1" appears,
        then the probability distribution of the number of non-"1"s that
        appear before the third "1" is a negative binomial distribution.

    noncentral_f(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        noncentral_f(dfnum, dfden, nonc, size=None)

        Draw samples from the noncentral F distribution.

        Samples are drawn from an F distribution with specified parameters,
        `dfnum` (degrees of freedom in numerator) and `dfden` (degrees of
        freedom in denominator), where both parameters > 1.
        `nonc` is the non-centrality parameter.

        .. note::
            New code should use the
            `~numpy.random.Generator.noncentral_f`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dfnum : float or array_like of floats
            Numerator degrees of freedom, must be > 0.

            .. versionchanged:: 1.14.0

        dfden : float or array_like of floats
            Denominator degrees of freedom, must be > 0.
        nonc : float or array_like of floats
            Non-centrality parameter, the sum of the squares of the numerator
            means, must be >= 0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``dfnum``, ``dfden``, and ``nonc``
            are all scalars.  Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(dfnum, dfden, nonc).size``
            samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized noncentral Fisher distribution.

        Notes
        -----
        When calculating the power of an experiment (power = probability of
        rejecting the null hypothesis when a specific alternative is true) the
        non-central F statistic becomes important.  When the null hypothesis is
        true, the F statistic follows a central F distribution. When the null
        hypothesis is not true, then it follows a non-central F statistic.

        Examples
        --------
        In a study, testing for a specific alternative to the null hypothesis
        requires use of the Noncentral F distribution. We need to calculate the
        area in the tail of the distribution that exceeds the value of the F
        distribution for the null hypothesis.  We'll plot the two probability
        distributions for comparison.

    normal(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=None)

        Draw random samples from a normal (Gaussian) distribution.

        The probability density function of the normal distribution, first
        derived by De Moivre and 200 years later by both Gauss and Laplace
        independently [2]_, is often called the bell curve because of
        its characteristic shape (see the example below).

        The normal distributions occurs often in nature.  For example, it
        describes the commonly occurring distribution of samples influenced
        by a large number of tiny, random disturbances, each with its own
        unique distribution [2]_.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.normal`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        loc : float or array_like of floats
            Mean ("centre") of the distribution.
        scale : float or array_like of floats
            Standard deviation (spread or "width") of the distribution. Must be
            non-negative.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``loc`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(loc, scale).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized normal distribution.

            cumulative density function, etc.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Gaussian distribution is

        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 \pi \sigma^2 }}
                         e^{ - \frac{ (x - \mu)^2 } {2 \sigma^2} },

        where :math:`\mu` is the mean and :math:`\sigma` the standard
        deviation. The square of the standard deviation, :math:`\sigma^2`,
        is called the variance.

        The function has its peak at the mean, and its "spread" increases with
        the standard deviation (the function reaches 0.607 times its maximum at
        :math:`x + \sigma` and :math:`x - \sigma` [2]_).  This implies that
        normal is more likely to return samples lying close to the mean, rather
        than those far away.

        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples from the distribution:

        >>> mu, sigma = 0, 0.1 # mean and standard deviation
        >>> s = np.random.normal(mu, sigma, 1000)

        Verify the mean and the variance:

        >>> abs(sigma - np.std(s, ddof=1))
        0.1  # may vary

        Display the histogram of the samples, along with
        the probability density function:

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s, 30, density=True)
        >>> plt.plot(bins, 1/(sigma * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)) *
        ...                np.exp( - (bins - mu)**2 / (2 * sigma**2) ),
        ...          linewidth=2, color='r')
        >>> plt.show()

               [ 0.39924804,  4.68456316,  4.99394529,  4.84057254]])  # random

    pareto(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        pareto(a, size=None)

        Draw samples from a Pareto II or Lomax distribution with
        specified shape.

        The Lomax or Pareto II distribution is a shifted Pareto
        distribution. The classical Pareto distribution can be
        obtained from the Lomax distribution by adding 1 and
        multiplying by the scale parameter ``m`` (see Notes).  The
        smallest value of the Lomax distribution is zero while for the
        classical Pareto distribution it is ``mu``, where the standard
        Pareto distribution has location ``mu = 1``.  Lomax can also
        be considered as a simplified version of the Generalized
        Pareto distribution (available in SciPy), with the scale set
        to one and the location set to zero.

        The Pareto distribution must be greater than zero, and is
        unbounded above.  It is also known as the "80-20 rule".  In
        this distribution, 80 percent of the weights are in the lowest
        20 percent of the range, while the other 20 percent fill the
        remaining 80 percent of the range.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.pareto`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        a : float or array_like of floats
            Shape of the distribution. Must be positive.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``a`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
            ``np.array(a).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized Pareto distribution.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Pareto distribution is

        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{am^a}{x^{a+1}}

        where :math:`a` is the shape and :math:`m` the scale.

        The Pareto distribution, named after the Italian economist
        Vilfredo Pareto, is a power law probability distribution
        useful in many real world problems.  Outside the field of
        economics it is generally referred to as the Bradford
        distribution. Pareto developed the distribution to describe
        the distribution of wealth in an economy.  It has also found
        use in insurance, web page access statistics, oil field sizes,
        and many other problems, including the download frequency for
        projects in Sourceforge [1]_.  It is one of the so-called
        "fat-tailed" distributions.

    poisson(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        poisson(lam=1.0, size=None)

        Draw samples from a Poisson distribution.

        The Poisson distribution is the limit of the binomial distribution
        for large N.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.poisson`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        lam : float or array_like of floats
            Expected number of events occurring in a fixed-time interval,
            must be >= 0. A sequence must be broadcastable over the requested
            size.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``lam`` is a scalar. Otherwise,
            ``np.array(lam).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized Poisson distribution.

        See Also

        The Poisson distribution

        .. math:: f(k; \lambda)=\frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}

        For events with an expected separation :math:`\lambda` the Poisson
        distribution :math:`f(k; \lambda)` describes the probability of
        :math:`k` events occurring within the observed
        interval :math:`\lambda`.

        Because the output is limited to the range of the C int64 type, a
        ValueError is raised when `lam` is within 10 sigma of the maximum
        representable value.

            a single value is returned if ``a`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
            ``np.array(a).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized power distribution.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If a <= 0.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density function is

        .. math:: P(x; a) = ax^{a-1}, 0 \le x \le 1, a>0.

        The power function distribution is just the inverse of the Pareto
        distribution. It may also be seen as a special case of the Beta
        distribution.

        It is used, for example, in modeling the over-reporting of insurance
        claims.

        rand(d0, d1, ..., dn)

        Random values in a given shape.

        .. note::
            This is a convenience function for users porting code from Matlab,
            and wraps `random_sample`. That function takes a
            tuple to specify the size of the output, which is consistent with
            other NumPy functions like `numpy.zeros` and `numpy.ones`.

        Create an array of the given shape and populate it with
        random samples from a uniform distribution
        over ``[0, 1)``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        d0, d1, ..., dn : int, optional
            The dimensions of the returned array, must be non-negative.
            If no argument is given a single Python float is returned.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray, shape ``(d0, d1, ..., dn)``
            Random values.

    randint(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        randint(low, high=None, size=None, dtype=int)

        Return random integers from `low` (inclusive) to `high` (exclusive).

        Return random integers from the "discrete uniform" distribution of
        the specified dtype in the "half-open" interval [`low`, `high`). If
        `high` is None (the default), then results are from [0, `low`).

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.integers`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        low : int or array-like of ints
            Lowest (signed) integers to be drawn from the distribution (unless
            ``high=None``, in which case this parameter is one above the
            *highest* such integer).
        high : int or array-like of ints, optional
            If provided, one above the largest (signed) integer to be drawn
            from the distribution (see above for behavior if ``high=None``).
            If array-like, must contain integer values
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.
        dtype : dtype, optional
            Desired dtype of the result. Byteorder must be native.
            The default value is int.

        Returns
        -------
        out : int or ndarray of ints
            `size`-shaped array of random integers from the appropriate
            distribution, or a single such random int if `size` not provided.

        See Also
        --------
        random_integers : similar to `randint`, only for the closed
            interval [`low`, `high`], and 1 is the lowest value if `high` is
            omitted.
        random.Generator.integers: which should be used for new code.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> np.random.randint(2, size=10)
        array([1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]) # random
        >>> np.random.randint(1, size=10)
        array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

        Generate a 2 x 4 array of ints between 0 and 4, inclusive:

        >>> np.random.randint(5, size=(2, 4))
        array([[4, 0, 2, 1], # random
               [3, 2, 2, 0]])

        Generate a 1 x 3 array with 3 different upper bounds

        >>> np.random.randint(1, [3, 5, 10])
        array([2, 2, 9]) # random

        Generate a 1 by 3 array with 3 different lower bounds

        >>> np.random.randint([1, 5, 7], 10)
        array([9, 8, 7]) # random

        Generate a 2 by 4 array using broadcasting with dtype of uint8

        >>> np.random.randint([1, 3, 5, 7], [[10], [20]], dtype=np.uint8)
        array([[ 8,  6,  9,  7], # random
               [ 1, 16,  9, 12]], dtype=uint8)

    randn(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        randn(d0, d1, ..., dn)

        Return a sample (or samples) from the "standard normal" distribution.

        .. note::
            This is a convenience function for users porting code from Matlab,
            and wraps `standard_normal`. That function takes a
            tuple to specify the size of the output, which is consistent with
            other NumPy functions like `numpy.zeros` and `numpy.ones`.

        .. note::
            New code should use the
            `~numpy.random.Generator.standard_normal`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        If positive int_like arguments are provided, `randn` generates an array
        of shape ``(d0, d1, ..., dn)``, filled
        with random floats sampled from a univariate "normal" (Gaussian)
        distribution of mean 0 and variance 1. A single float randomly sampled
        from the distribution is returned if no argument is provided.

        Parameters
        ----------
        d0, d1, ..., dn : int, optional
            The dimensions of the returned array, must be non-negative.
            If no argument is given a single Python float is returned.

        Returns
        -------
        Z : ndarray or float
            A ``(d0, d1, ..., dn)``-shaped array of floating-point samples from
            the standard normal distribution, or a single such float if
            no parameters were supplied.

        See Also
        --------
        standard_normal : Similar, but takes a tuple as its argument.
        normal : Also accepts mu and sigma arguments.
        random.Generator.standard_normal: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        For random samples from the normal distribution with mean ``mu`` and
        standard deviation ``sigma``, use::

            sigma * np.random.randn(...) + mu

        Examples
        --------
        >>> np.random.randn()
        2.1923875335537315  # random

        Two-by-four array of samples from the normal distribution with
        mean 3 and standard deviation 2.5:

        >>> 3 + 2.5 * np.random.randn(2, 4)
        array([[-4.49401501,  4.00950034, -1.81814867,  7.29718677],   # random
               [ 0.39924804,  4.68456316,  4.99394529,  4.84057254]])  # random

    random(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        random(size=None)

        Return random floats in the half-open interval [0.0, 1.0). Alias for
        `random_sample` to ease forward-porting to the new random API.

    random_integers(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        random_integers(low, high=None, size=None)

        Random integers of type `np.int_` between `low` and `high`, inclusive.

        Return random integers of type `np.int_` from the "discrete uniform"
        distribution in the closed interval [`low`, `high`].  If `high` is
        None (the default), then results are from [1, `low`]. The `np.int_`
        type translates to the C long integer type and its precision
        is platform dependent.

        This function has been deprecated. Use randint instead.

        .. deprecated:: 1.11.0

        Parameters
        ----------
        low : int
            Lowest (signed) integer to be drawn from the distribution (unless
            ``high=None``, in which case this parameter is the *highest* such
            integer).
        high : int, optional
            If provided, the largest (signed) integer to be drawn from the
            distribution (see above for behavior if ``high=None``).
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.

        Returns
        -------
        out : int or ndarray of ints
            `size`-shaped array of random integers from the appropriate
            distribution, or a single such random int if `size` not provided.

        See Also
        --------
        randint : Similar to `random_integers`, only for the half-open
            interval [`low`, `high`), and 0 is the lowest value if `high` is
            omitted.

        Notes
        -----
        To sample from N evenly spaced floating-point numbers between a and b,
        use::

          a + (b - a) * (np.random.random_integers(N) - 1) / (N - 1.)

        Examples
        --------
        >>> np.random.random_integers(5)
        4 # random
        >>> type(np.random.random_integers(5))
        <class 'numpy.int64'>
        >>> np.random.random_integers(5, size=(3,2))
        array([[5, 4], # random
               [3, 3],
               [4, 5]])

        Choose five random numbers from the set of five evenly-spaced
        numbers between 0 and 2.5, inclusive (*i.e.*, from the set
        :math:`{0, 5/8, 10/8, 15/8, 20/8}`):

        >>> 2.5 * (np.random.random_integers(5, size=(5,)) - 1) / 4.
        array([ 0.625,  1.25 ,  0.625,  0.625,  2.5  ]) # random

        Roll two six sided dice 1000 times and sum the results:

        >>> d1 = np.random.random_integers(1, 6, 1000)
        >>> d2 = np.random.random_integers(1, 6, 1000)
        >>> dsums = d1 + d2

        Display results as a histogram:

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(dsums, 11, density=True)
        >>> plt.show()

    random_sample(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        random_sample(size=None)

        Return random floats in the half-open interval [0.0, 1.0).

        Results are from the "continuous uniform" distribution over the
        stated interval.  To sample :math:`Unif[a, b), b > a` multiply
        the output of `random_sample` by `(b-a)` and add `a`::

          (b - a) * random_sample() + a

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.random`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.

        Returns
        -------
        out : float or ndarray of floats
            Array of random floats of shape `size` (unless ``size=None``, in which
            case a single float is returned).

        See Also
        --------
        random.Generator.random: which should be used for new code.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> np.random.random_sample()
        0.47108547995356098 # random
        >>> type(np.random.random_sample())
        <class 'float'>
        >>> np.random.random_sample((5,))
        array([ 0.30220482,  0.86820401,  0.1654503 ,  0.11659149,  0.54323428]) # random

        Three-by-two array of random numbers from [-5, 0):

        >>> 5 * np.random.random_sample((3, 2)) - 5
        array([[-3.99149989, -0.52338984], # random

        documentation.

    rayleigh(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        rayleigh(scale=1.0, size=None)

        Draw samples from a Rayleigh distribution.

        The :math:`\chi` and Weibull distributions are generalizations of the
        Rayleigh.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.rayleigh`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        scale : float or array_like of floats, optional
            Scale, also equals the mode. Must be non-negative. Default is 1.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``scale`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
            ``np.array(scale).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized Rayleigh distribution.

        See Also
        --------
        random.Generator.rayleigh: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density function for the Rayleigh distribution is

        .. math:: P(x;scale) = \frac{x}{scale^2}e^{\frac{-x^2}{2 \cdotp scale^2}}

        The Rayleigh distribution would arise, for example, if the East
        and North components of the wind velocity had identical zero-mean
        Gaussian distributions.  Then the wind speed would have a Rayleigh
        distribution.

        Wave heights tend to follow a Rayleigh distribution. If the mean wave
        height is 1 meter, what fraction of waves are likely to be larger than 3
        meters?

        >>> meanvalue = 1
        >>> modevalue = np.sqrt(2 / np.pi) * meanvalue
        >>> s = np.random.rayleigh(modevalue, 1000000)

        The percentage of waves larger than 3 meters is:

        >>> 100.*sum(s>3)/1000000.

        This is a convenience, legacy function that exists to support
        older code that uses the singleton RandomState. Best practice

        the random variate generation methods exposed directly in
        the random module.

    set_state(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        set_state(state)

        Set the internal state of the generator from a tuple.

        For use if one has reason to manually (re-)set the internal state of
        the bit generator used by the RandomState instance. By default,
        RandomState uses the "Mersenne Twister"[1]_ pseudo-random number
        generating algorithm.

        Parameters
        ----------
        state : {tuple(str, ndarray of 624 uints, int, int, float), dict}
            The `state` tuple has the following items:

            1. the string 'MT19937', specifying the Mersenne Twister algorithm.
            2. a 1-D array of 624 unsigned integers ``keys``.
            3. an integer ``pos``.
            4. an integer ``has_gauss``.
            5. a float ``cached_gaussian``.

            If state is a dictionary, it is directly set using the BitGenerators
            `state` property.

        Returns
        -------
        out : None
            Returns 'None' on success.

        See Also
        --------
        get_state

        Notes
        -----
        `set_state` and `get_state` are not needed to work with any of the
        random distributions in NumPy. If the internal state is manually altered,
        the user should know exactly what he/she is doing.

        For backwards compatibility, the form (str, array of 624 uints, int) is
        also accepted although it is missing some information about the cached
        Gaussian value: ``state = ('MT19937', keys, pos)``.

    shuffle(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        shuffle(x)

        Modify a sequence in-place by shuffling its contents.

        This function only shuffles the array along the first axis of a
        multi-dimensional array. The order of sub-arrays is changed but
        their contents remains the same.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.shuffle`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : ndarray or MutableSequence
            The array, list or mutable sequence to be shuffled.

        Returns
        -------
        None

        See Also
        --------
        random.Generator.shuffle: which should be used for new code.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> arr = np.arange(10)
        >>> np.random.shuffle(arr)
        >>> arr
        [1 7 5 2 9 4 3 6 0 8] # random

        Multi-dimensional arrays are only shuffled along the first axis:

        >>> arr = np.arange(9).reshape((3, 3))
        >>> np.random.shuffle(arr)
        >>> arr
        array([[3, 4, 5], # random
               [6, 7, 8],
               [0, 1, 2]])

    standard_cauchy(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        standard_cauchy(size=None)

        Draw samples from a standard Cauchy distribution with mode = 0.

        Also known as the Lorentz distribution.

        .. note::
            New code should use the
            `~numpy.random.Generator.standard_cauchy`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.

        Returns
        -------
        samples : ndarray or scalar
            The drawn samples.

        See Also
        --------
        random.Generator.standard_cauchy: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density function for the full Cauchy distribution is

        .. math:: P(x; x_0, \gamma) = \frac{1}{\pi \gamma \bigl[ 1+
                  (\frac{x-x_0}{\gamma})^2 \bigr] }

        and the Standard Cauchy distribution just sets :math:`x_0=0` and
        :math:`\gamma=1`

        The Cauchy distribution arises in the solution to the driven harmonic
        oscillator problem, and also describes spectral line broadening. It
        also describes the distribution of values at which a line tilted at
        a random angle will cut the x axis.

        When studying hypothesis tests that assume normality, seeing how the
        tests perform on data from a Cauchy distribution is a good indicator of
        their sensitivity to a heavy-tailed distribution, since the Cauchy looks
        very much like a Gaussian distribution, but with heavier tails.

    standard_exponential(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        standard_exponential(size=None)

        Draw samples from the standard exponential distribution.

        `standard_exponential` is identical to the exponential distribution
        with a scale parameter of 1.

        .. note::
            New code should use the
            `~numpy.random.Generator.standard_exponential`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  Default is None, in which case a
            single value is returned.

        Returns
        -------

    standard_gamma(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        standard_gamma(shape, size=None)

        Draw samples from a standard Gamma distribution.

        Samples are drawn from a Gamma distribution with specified parameters,
        shape (sometimes designated "k") and scale=1.

        .. note::
            New code should use the
            `~numpy.random.Generator.standard_gamma`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        shape : float or array_like of floats
            Parameter, must be non-negative.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``shape`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
            ``np.array(shape).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized standard gamma distribution.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Gamma distribution is

        .. math:: p(x) = x^{k-1}\frac{e^{-x/\theta}}{\theta^k\Gamma(k)},

        where :math:`k` is the shape and :math:`\theta` the scale,
        and :math:`\Gamma` is the Gamma function.

        The Gamma distribution is often used to model the times to failure of
        electronic components, and arises naturally in processes for which the
        waiting times between Poisson distributed events are relevant.

    standard_normal(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        standard_normal(size=None)

        Draw samples from a standard Normal distribution (mean=0, stdev=1).

        .. note::
            New code should use the
            `~numpy.random.Generator.standard_normal`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;

    standard_t(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        standard_t(df, size=None)

        Draw samples from a standard Student's t distribution with `df` degrees
        of freedom.

        A special case of the hyperbolic distribution.  As `df` gets
        large, the result resembles that of the standard normal
        distribution (`standard_normal`).

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.standard_t`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        df : float or array_like of floats
            Degrees of freedom, must be > 0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``df`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
            ``np.array(df).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized standard Student's t distribution.

        See Also
        --------
        random.Generator.standard_t: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density function for the t distribution is

        .. math:: P(x, df) = \frac{\Gamma(\frac{df+1}{2})}{\sqrt{\pi df}
                  \Gamma(\frac{df}{2})}\Bigl( 1+\frac{x^2}{df} \Bigr)^{-(df+1)/2}

        The t test is based on an assumption that the data come from a
        Normal distribution. The t test provides a way to test whether
        the sample mean (that is the mean calculated from the data) is
        a good estimate of the true mean.

        The derivation of the t-distribution was first published in
        1908 by William Gosset while working for the Guinness Brewery
        in Dublin. Due to proprietary issues, he had to publish under
        a pseudonym, and so he used the name Student.

               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-distribution

        Examples
        --------
        From Dalgaard page 83 [1]_, suppose the daily energy intake for 11
        women in kilojoules (kJ) is:

        >>> intake = np.array([5260., 5470, 5640, 6180, 6390, 6515, 6805, 7515, \
        ...                    7515, 8230, 8770])

        Does their energy intake deviate systematically from the recommended
        value of 7725 kJ? Our null hypothesis will be the absence of deviation,
        and the alternate hypothesis will be the presence of an effect that could be
        either positive or negative, hence making our test 2-tailed.

        Because we are estimating the mean and we have N=11 values in our sample,
        we have N-1=10 degrees of freedom. We set our significance level to 95% and
        compute the t statistic using the empirical mean and empirical standard
        deviation of our intake. We use a ddof of 1 to base the computation of our
        empirical standard deviation on an unbiased estimate of the variance (note:
        the final estimate is not unbiased due to the concave nature of the square
        root).

        >>> np.mean(intake)
        6753.636363636364
        >>> intake.std(ddof=1)
        1142.1232221373727
        >>> t = (np.mean(intake)-7725)/(intake.std(ddof=1)/np.sqrt(len(intake)))
        >>> t
        -2.8207540608310198

        We draw 1000000 samples from Student's t distribution with the adequate
        degrees of freedom.

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> s = np.random.standard_t(10, size=1000000)
        >>> h = plt.hist(s, bins=100, density=True)

        Does our t statistic land in one of the two critical regions found at
        both tails of the distribution?

        >>> np.sum(np.abs(t) < np.abs(s)) / float(len(s))
        0.018318  #random < 0.05, statistic is in critical region

        The probability value for this 2-tailed test is about 1.83%, which is
        lower than the 5% pre-determined significance threshold.

        Therefore, the probability of observing values as extreme as our intake
        conditionally on the null hypothesis being true is too low, and we reject
        the null hypothesis of no deviation.

    triangular(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        triangular(left, mode, right, size=None)

        Draw samples from the triangular distribution over the
        interval ``[left, right]``.

        The triangular distribution is a continuous probability
        distribution with lower limit left, peak at mode, and upper
        limit right. Unlike the other distributions, these parameters
        directly define the shape of the pdf.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.triangular`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        left : float or array_like of floats
            Lower limit.
        mode : float or array_like of floats
            The value where the peak of the distribution occurs.
            The value must fulfill the condition ``left <= mode <= right``.
        right : float or array_like of floats
            Upper limit, must be larger than `left`.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``left``, ``mode``, and ``right``
            are all scalars.  Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(left, mode, right).size``
            samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized triangular distribution.

        See Also
        --------
        random.Generator.triangular: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density function for the triangular distribution is

        .. math:: P(x;l, m, r) = \begin{cases}
                  \frac{2(x-l)}{(r-l)(m-l)}& \text{for $l \leq x \leq m$},\\
                  \frac{2(r-x)}{(r-l)(r-m)}& \text{for $m \leq x \leq r$},\\
                  0& \text{otherwise}.
                  \end{cases}

        The triangular distribution is often used in ill-defined
        problems where the underlying distribution is not known, but
        some knowledge of the limits and mode exists. Often it is used
        in simulations.

        Examples
        --------
        Draw values from the distribution and plot the histogram:

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> h = plt.hist(np.random.triangular(-3, 0, 8, 100000), bins=200,

    uniform(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        uniform(low=0.0, high=1.0, size=None)

        Draw samples from a uniform distribution.

        Samples are uniformly distributed over the half-open interval
        ``[low, high)`` (includes low, but excludes high).  In other words,
        any value within the given interval is equally likely to be drawn
        by `uniform`.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.uniform`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        low : float or array_like of floats, optional
            Lower boundary of the output interval.  All values generated will be
            greater than or equal to low.  The default value is 0.
        high : float or array_like of floats
            Upper boundary of the output interval.  All values generated will be
            less than or equal to high.  The high limit may be included in the
            returned array of floats due to floating-point rounding in the
            equation ``low + (high-low) * random_sample()``.  The default value
            is 1.0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``low`` and ``high`` are both scalars.
            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(low, high).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized uniform distribution.

        See Also
        --------
        randint : Discrete uniform distribution, yielding integers.
        random_integers : Discrete uniform distribution over the closed
                          interval ``[low, high]``.
        random_sample : Floats uniformly distributed over ``[0, 1)``.
        random : Alias for `random_sample`.
        rand : Convenience function that accepts dimensions as input, e.g.,
               ``rand(2,2)`` would generate a 2-by-2 array of floats,
               uniformly distributed over ``[0, 1)``.
        random.Generator.uniform: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density function of the uniform distribution is

        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{1}{b - a}

        anywhere within the interval ``[a, b)``, and zero elsewhere.

        When ``high`` == ``low``, values of ``low`` will be returned.
        If ``high`` < ``low``, the results are officially undefined
        and may eventually raise an error, i.e. do not rely on this
        function to behave when passed arguments satisfying that
        inequality condition. The ``high`` limit may be included in the
        returned array of floats due to floating-point rounding in the
        equation ``low + (high-low) * random_sample()``. For example:

        >>> x = np.float32(5*0.99999999)
        >>> x
        5.0


        Examples
        --------
        Draw samples from the distribution:

        >>> s = np.random.uniform(-1,0,1000)

        All values are within the given interval:

        >>> np.all(s >= -1)
        True
        >>> np.all(s < 0)
        True

        Display the histogram of the samples, along with the
        probability density function:

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s, 15, density=True)
        >>> plt.plot(bins, np.ones_like(bins), linewidth=2, color='r')
        >>> plt.show()

    vonmises(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        vonmises(mu, kappa, size=None)

        Draw samples from a von Mises distribution.

        Samples are drawn from a von Mises distribution with specified mode
        (mu) and dispersion (kappa), on the interval [-pi, pi].

        The von Mises distribution (also known as the circular normal
        distribution) is a continuous probability distribution on the unit
        circle.  It may be thought of as the circular analogue of the normal
        distribution.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.vonmises`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mu : float or array_like of floats
            Mode ("center") of the distribution.
        kappa : float or array_like of floats
            Dispersion of the distribution, has to be >=0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``mu`` and ``kappa`` are both scalars.
            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(mu, kappa).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized von Mises distribution.

        See Also
        --------
        scipy.stats.vonmises : probability density function, distribution, or
            cumulative density function, etc.
        random.Generator.vonmises: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the von Mises distribution is

        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{e^{\kappa cos(x-\mu)}}{2\pi I_0(\kappa)},

        where :math:`\mu` is the mode and :math:`\kappa` the dispersion,
        and :math:`I_0(\kappa)` is the modified Bessel function of order 0.

        The von Mises is named for Richard Edler von Mises, who was born in
        Austria-Hungary, in what is now the Ukraine.  He fled to the United
        States in 1939 and became a professor at Harvard.  He worked in
        probability theory, aerodynamics, fluid mechanics, and philosophy of
        science.

    wald(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        wald(mean, scale, size=None)

        Draw samples from a Wald, or inverse Gaussian, distribution.

        As the scale approaches infinity, the distribution becomes more like a
        Gaussian. Some references claim that the Wald is an inverse Gaussian
        with mean equal to 1, but this is by no means universal.

        The inverse Gaussian distribution was first studied in relationship to
        Brownian motion. In 1956 M.C.K. Tweedie used the name inverse Gaussian
        because there is an inverse relationship between the time to cover a
        unit distance and distance covered in unit time.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.wald`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        mean : float or array_like of floats
            Distribution mean, must be > 0.
        scale : float or array_like of floats
            Scale parameter, must be > 0.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``mean`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.
            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(mean, scale).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized Wald distribution.

        See Also
        --------
        random.Generator.wald: which should be used for new code.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density function for the Wald distribution is

        .. math:: P(x;mean,scale) = \sqrt{\frac{scale}{2\pi x^3}}e^
                                    \frac{-scale(x-mean)^2}{2\cdotp mean^2x}

        As noted above the inverse Gaussian distribution first arise
        from attempts to model Brownian motion. It is also a
        competitor to the Weibull for use in reliability modeling and
        modeling stock returns and interest rate processes.

    weibull(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        weibull(a, size=None)

        Draw samples from a Weibull distribution.

        Draw samples from a 1-parameter Weibull distribution with the given
        shape parameter `a`.

        .. math:: X = (-ln(U))^{1/a}

        Here, U is drawn from the uniform distribution over (0,1].

        The more common 2-parameter Weibull, including a scale parameter
        :math:`\lambda` is just :math:`X = \lambda(-ln(U))^{1/a}`.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.weibull`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;
            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        a : float or array_like of floats
            Shape parameter of the distribution.  Must be nonnegative.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``a`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,
            ``np.array(a).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns

        Notes
        -----
        The Weibull (or Type III asymptotic extreme value distribution
        for smallest values, SEV Type III, or Rosin-Rammler
        distribution) is one of a class of Generalized Extreme Value
        (GEV) distributions used in modeling extreme value problems.
        This class includes the Gumbel and Frechet distributions.

        The probability density for the Weibull distribution is

        .. math:: p(x) = \frac{a}
                         {\lambda}(\frac{x}{\lambda})^{a-1}e^{-(x/\lambda)^a},

        where :math:`a` is the shape and :math:`\lambda` the scale.

        The function has its peak (the mode) at
        :math:`\lambda(\frac{a-1}{a})^{1/a}`.

        When ``a = 1``, the Weibull distribution reduces to the exponential
        distribution.

    zipf(...) method of numpy.random.mtrand.RandomState instance
        zipf(a, size=None)

        Draw samples from a Zipf distribution.

        Samples are drawn from a Zipf distribution with specified parameter
        `a` > 1.

        The Zipf distribution (also known as the zeta distribution) is a
        discrete probability distribution that satisfies Zipf's law: the
        frequency of an item is inversely proportional to its rank in a
        frequency table.

        .. note::
            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.zipf`
            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;

        Parameters
        ----------
        a : float or array_like of floats
            Distribution parameter. Must be greater than 1.
        size : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then
            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),
            a single value is returned if ``a`` is a scalar. Otherwise,
            ``np.array(a).size`` samples are drawn.

        Returns
        -------
        out : ndarray or scalar
            Drawn samples from the parameterized Zipf distribution.

        Notes
        -----
        The probability density for the Zipf distribution is

        .. math:: p(k) = \frac{k^{-a}}{\zeta(a)},

        for integers :math:`k \geq 1`, where :math:`\zeta` is the Riemann Zeta
        function.

        It is named for the American linguist George Kingsley Zipf, who noted
        that the frequency of any word in a sample of a language is inversely
        proportional to its rank in the frequency table.

NAME
    numpy.core.records

DESCRIPTION
    Record Arrays
    =============
    Record arrays expose the fields of structured arrays as properties.

    Most commonly, ndarrays contain elements of a single type, e.g. floats,
    integers, bools etc.  However, it is possible for elements to be combinations
    of these using structured types, such as::

      >>> a = np.array([(1, 2.0), (1, 2.0)], dtype=[('x', np.int64), ('y', np.float64)])
      >>> a
      array([(1, 2.), (1, 2.)], dtype=[('x', '<i8'), ('y', '<f8')])

    Here, each element consists of two fields: x (and int), and y (a float).
    This is known as a structured array.  The different fields are analogous
    to columns in a spread-sheet.  The different fields can be accessed as
    one would a dictionary::

      >>> a['x']
      array([1, 1])

      >>> a['y']
      array([2., 2.])

    Record arrays allow us to access fields as properties::

      >>> ar = np.rec.array(a)

      >>> ar.x
      array([1, 1])

      >>> ar.y
      array([2., 2.])

     |      form ``'col1, col2, col3'``, or as a list or tuple of strings in the
     |      form ``['col1', 'col2', 'col3']``.
     |      An empty list can be used, in that case default field names
     |      ('f0', 'f1', ...) are used.
     |  titles : sequence
     |      Sequence of title strings. An empty list can be used to leave titles
     |      out.
     |  aligned : bool, optional
     |      If True, align the fields by padding as the C-compiler would.
     |      Default is False.
     |  byteorder : str, optional
     |      If specified, all the fields will be changed to the
     |      provided byte-order.  Otherwise, the default byte-order is
     |      used. For all available string specifiers, see `dtype.newbyteorder`.

    class recarray(ndarray)
     |  recarray(shape, dtype=None, buf=None, offset=0, strides=None, formats=None, names=None, titles=None, byteorder=None, aligned=False, order='C')
     |
     |  Construct an ndarray that allows field access using attributes.
     |
     |  Arrays may have a data-types containing fields, analogous
     |  to columns in a spread sheet.  An example is ``[(x, int), (y, float)]``,
     |  where each entry in the array is a pair of ``(int, float)``.  Normally,
     |  these attributes are accessed using dictionary lookups such as ``arr['x']``
     |  and ``arr['y']``.  Record arrays allow the fields to be accessed as members
     |  of the array, using ``arr.x`` and ``arr.y``.
     |
     |  Parameters
     |  ----------
     |  shape : tuple
     |      Shape of output array.
     |  dtype : data-type, optional
     |      The desired data-type.  By default, the data-type is determined
     |      from `formats`, `names`, `titles`, `aligned` and `byteorder`.
     |  formats : list of data-types, optional
     |      A list containing the data-types for the different columns, e.g.
     |      ``['i4', 'f8', 'i4']``.  `formats` does *not* support the new
     |      convention of using types directly, i.e. ``(int, float, int)``.
     |      Note that `formats` must be a list, not a tuple.
     |      Given that `formats` is somewhat limited, we recommend specifying
     |      `dtype` instead.
     |  names : tuple of str, optional
     |      The name of each column, e.g. ``('x', 'y', 'z')``.
     |  buf : buffer, optional
     |      By default, a new array is created of the given shape and data-type.
     |      If `buf` is specified and is an object exposing the buffer interface,
     |      the array will use the memory from the existing buffer.  In this case,
     |      the `offset` and `strides` keywords are available.
     |
     |  Other Parameters
     |  ----------------
     |  titles : tuple of str, optional
     |      Aliases for column names.  For example, if `names` were
     |      ``('x', 'y', 'z')`` and `titles` is
     |      ``('x_coordinate', 'y_coordinate', 'z_coordinate')``, then
     |      ``arr['x']`` is equivalent to both ``arr.x`` and ``arr.x_coordinate``.
     |  byteorder : {'<', '>', '='}, optional
     |      Byte-order for all fields.
     |  aligned : bool, optional
     |      Align the fields in memory as the C-compiler would.
     |  strides : tuple of ints, optional
     |      Buffer (`buf`) is interpreted according to these strides (strides
     |      define how many bytes each array element, row, column, etc.
     |      occupy in memory).
     |  offset : int, optional
     |      Start reading buffer (`buf`) from this offset onwards.
     |  order : {'C', 'F'}, optional
     |      Row-major (C-style) or column-major (Fortran-style) order.
     |
     |  Returns
     |  -------
     |  rec : recarray
     |      Empty array of the given shape and type.
     |
     |  See Also
     |  --------
     |  core.records.fromrecords : Construct a record array from data.
     |  record : fundamental data-type for `recarray`.
     |  format_parser : determine a data-type from formats, names, titles.
     |
     |  Notes
     |  -----
     |  This constructor can be compared to ``empty``: it creates a new record
     |  array but does not fill it with data.  To create a record array from data,
     |  use one of the following methods:
     |
     |  1. Create a standard ndarray and convert it to a record array,
     |     using ``arr.view(np.recarray)``
     |  2. Use the `buf` keyword.
     |  3. Use `np.rec.fromrecords`.
     |
     |  Examples
     |  --------
     |  Create an array with two fields, ``x`` and ``y``:
     |
     |  >>> x = np.array([(1.0, 2), (3.0, 4)], dtype=[('x', '<f8'), ('y', '<i8')])
     |  >>> x
     |  array([(1., 2), (3., 4)], dtype=[('x', '<f8'), ('y', '<i8')])
     |
     |  >>> x['x']
     |  array([1., 3.])
     |
     |  View the array as a record array:
     |
     |  >>> x = x.view(np.recarray)
     |
     |  >>> x.x
     |  array([1., 3.])
     |
     |  >>> x.y
     |  array([2, 4])
     |
     |  Create a new, empty record array:
     |
     |  >>> np.recarray((2,),
     |  ... dtype=[('x', int), ('y', float), ('z', int)]) #doctest: +SKIP
     |  rec.array([(-1073741821, 1.2249118382103472e-301, 24547520),
     |         (3471280, 1.2134086255804012e-316, 0)],
     |        dtype=[('x', '<i4'), ('y', '<f8'), ('z', '<i4')])

     |      Returns the indices that would sort this array.
     |
     |      Refer to `numpy.argsort` for full documentation.

     |  astype(...)
     |      a.astype(dtype, order='K', casting='unsafe', subok=True, copy=True)
     |
     |      Copy of the array, cast to a specified type.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      dtype : str or dtype
     |          Typecode or data-type to which the array is cast.
     |      order : {'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, optional
     |          Controls the memory layout order of the result.
     |          'C' means C order, 'F' means Fortran order, 'A'
     |          means 'F' order if all the arrays are Fortran contiguous,
     |          'C' order otherwise, and 'K' means as close to the
     |          order the array elements appear in memory as possible.
     |          Default is 'K'.
     |      casting : {'no', 'equiv', 'safe', 'same_kind', 'unsafe'}, optional
     |          Controls what kind of data casting may occur. Defaults to 'unsafe'
     |          for backwards compatibility.
     |
     |            * 'no' means the data types should not be cast at all.
     |            * 'equiv' means only byte-order changes are allowed.
     |            * 'safe' means only casts which can preserve values are allowed.
     |            * 'same_kind' means only safe casts or casts within a kind,
     |              like float64 to float32, are allowed.
     |            * 'unsafe' means any data conversions may be done.
     |      subok : bool, optional
     |          If True, then sub-classes will be passed-through (default), otherwise
     |          the returned array will be forced to be a base-class array.
     |      copy : bool, optional
     |          By default, astype always returns a newly allocated array. If this
     |          is set to false, and the `dtype`, `order`, and `subok`
     |          requirements are satisfied, the input array is returned instead
     |          of a copy.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      arr_t : ndarray
     |          Unless `copy` is False and the other conditions for returning the input
     |          array are satisfied (see description for `copy` input parameter), `arr_t`
     |          is a new array of the same shape as the input array, with dtype, order
     |          given by `dtype`, `order`.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      .. versionchanged:: 1.17.0
     |         Casting between a simple data type and a structured one is possible only
     |         for "unsafe" casting.  Casting to multiple fields is allowed, but
     |         casting from multiple fields is not.
     |
     |      .. versionchanged:: 1.9.0
     |         Casting from numeric to string types in 'safe' casting mode requires
     |         that the string dtype length is long enough to store the max
     |         integer/float value converted.
     |
     |      Raises
     |      ------
     |      ComplexWarning
     |          When casting from complex to float or int. To avoid this,
     |          one should use ``a.real.astype(t)``.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 2.5])
     |      >>> x
     |      array([1. ,  2. ,  2.5])
     |
     |      >>> x.astype(int)
     |      array([1, 2, 2])
     |
     |  byteswap(...)
     |      a.byteswap(inplace=False)
     |
     |      Swap the bytes of the array elements
     |
     |      Toggle between low-endian and big-endian data representation by
     |      returning a byteswapped array, optionally swapped in-place.
     |      Arrays of byte-strings are not swapped. The real and imaginary
     |      parts of a complex number are swapped individually.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      inplace : bool, optional
     |          If ``True``, swap bytes in-place, default is ``False``.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      out : ndarray
     |          The byteswapped array. If `inplace` is ``True``, this is
     |          a view to self.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      >>> A = np.array([1, 256, 8755], dtype=np.int16)
     |      >>> list(map(hex, A))
     |      ['0x1', '0x100', '0x2233']
     |      >>> A.byteswap(inplace=True)
     |      array([  256,     1, 13090], dtype=int16)
     |      >>> list(map(hex, A))
     |      ['0x100', '0x1', '0x3322']
     |
     |      Arrays of byte-strings are not swapped
     |
     |      >>> A = np.array([b'ceg', b'fac'])
     |      >>> A.byteswap()
     |      array([b'ceg', b'fac'], dtype='|S3')
     |
     |      ``A.newbyteorder().byteswap()`` produces an array with the same values
     |        but different representation in memory
     |
     |      >>> A = np.array([1, 2, 3])
     |      >>> A.view(np.uint8)
     |      array([1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
     |             0, 0], dtype=uint8)
     |      >>> A.newbyteorder().byteswap(inplace=True)
     |      array([1, 2, 3])
     |      >>> A.view(np.uint8)
     |      array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

     |  copy(...)
     |      a.copy(order='C')
     |
     |      Return a copy of the array.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      order : {'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, optional
     |          Controls the memory layout of the copy. 'C' means C-order,
     |          'F' means F-order, 'A' means 'F' if `a` is Fortran contiguous,
     |          'C' otherwise. 'K' means match the layout of `a` as closely
     |          as possible. (Note that this function and :func:`numpy.copy` are very
     |          similar but have different default values for their order=
     |          arguments, and this function always passes sub-classes through.)

     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      This function is the preferred method for creating an array copy.  The
     |      function :func:`numpy.copy` is similar, but it defaults to using order 'K',
     |      and will not pass sub-classes through by default.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      >>> x = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]], order='F')
     |
     |      >>> y = x.copy()
     |

     |             [0, 0, 0]])
     |
     |      >>> y

     |
     |  cumprod(...)

     |
     |      Return specified diagonals. In NumPy 1.9 the returned array is a
     |      read-only view instead of a copy as in previous NumPy versions.  In
     |      a future version the read-only restriction will be removed.

     |
     |  dump(...)
     |      a.dump(file)
     |
     |      Dump a pickle of the array to the specified file.
     |      The array can be read back with pickle.load or numpy.load.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      file : str or Path
     |          A string naming the dump file.
     |
     |          .. versionchanged:: 1.17.0
     |              `pathlib.Path` objects are now accepted.
     |
     |  dumps(...)
     |      a.dumps()
     |
     |      Returns the pickle of the array as a string.
     |      pickle.loads will convert the string back to an array.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      None
     |
     |  fill(...)
     |      a.fill(value)
     |
     |      Fill the array with a scalar value.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      value : scalar
     |          All elements of `a` will be assigned this value.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      >>> a = np.array([1, 2])
     |      >>> a.fill(0)
     |      >>> a
     |      array([0, 0])
     |      >>> a = np.empty(2)
     |      >>> a.fill(1)
     |      >>> a
     |      array([1.,  1.])
     |
     |      Fill expects a scalar value and always behaves the same as assigning
     |      to a single array element.  The following is a rare example where this
     |      distinction is important:
     |
     |      >>> a = np.array([None, None], dtype=object)
     |      >>> a[0] = np.array(3)
     |      >>> a
     |      array([array(3), None], dtype=object)
     |      >>> a.fill(np.array(3))
     |      >>> a
     |      array([array(3), array(3)], dtype=object)
     |
     |      Where other forms of assignments will unpack the array being assigned:
     |
     |      >>> a[...] = np.array(3)
     |      >>> a
     |      array([3, 3], dtype=object)
     |
     |  flatten(...)
     |      a.flatten(order='C')
     |
     |      Return a copy of the array collapsed into one dimension.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      order : {'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}, optional
     |          'C' means to flatten in row-major (C-style) order.
     |          'F' means to flatten in column-major (Fortran-
     |          style) order. 'A' means to flatten in column-major
     |          order if `a` is Fortran *contiguous* in memory,
     |          row-major order otherwise. 'K' means to flatten
     |          `a` in the order the elements occur in memory.
     |          The default is 'C'.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      y : ndarray
     |          A copy of the input array, flattened to one dimension.
     |
     |      See Also
     |      --------
     |      ravel : Return a flattened array.
     |      flat : A 1-D flat iterator over the array.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      >>> a = np.array([[1,2], [3,4]])
     |      >>> a.flatten()
     |      array([1, 2, 3, 4])
     |      >>> a.flatten('F')
     |      array([1, 3, 2, 4])
     |
     |  getfield(...)
     |      a.getfield(dtype, offset=0)
     |
     |      Returns a field of the given array as a certain type.
     |
     |      A field is a view of the array data with a given data-type. The values in
     |      the view are determined by the given type and the offset into the current
     |      array in bytes. The offset needs to be such that the view dtype fits in the
     |      array dtype; for example an array of dtype complex128 has 16-byte elements.
     |      If taking a view with a 32-bit integer (4 bytes), the offset needs to be
     |      between 0 and 12 bytes.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      dtype : str or dtype
     |          The data type of the view. The dtype size of the view can not be larger
     |          than that of the array itself.
     |      offset : int
     |          Number of bytes to skip before beginning the element view.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      >>> x = np.diag([1.+1.j]*2)
     |      >>> x[1, 1] = 2 + 4.j
     |      >>> x
     |      array([[1.+1.j,  0.+0.j],
     |             [0.+0.j,  2.+4.j]])
     |      >>> x.getfield(np.float64)
     |      array([[1.,  0.],
     |             [0.,  2.]])
     |
     |      By choosing an offset of 8 bytes we can select the complex part of the
     |      array for our view:
     |
     |      >>> x.getfield(np.float64, offset=8)
     |      array([[1.,  0.],
     |             [0.,  4.]])
     |
     |  item(...)
     |      a.item(*args)
     |
     |      Copy an element of an array to a standard Python scalar and return it.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      \*args : Arguments (variable number and type)
     |
     |          * none: in this case, the method only works for arrays
     |            with one element (`a.size == 1`), which element is
     |            copied into a standard Python scalar object and returned.
     |
     |          * int_type: this argument is interpreted as a flat index into
     |            the array, specifying which element to copy and return.
     |
     |          * tuple of int_types: functions as does a single int_type argument,
     |            except that the argument is interpreted as an nd-index into the
     |            array.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      z : Standard Python scalar object
     |          A copy of the specified element of the array as a suitable
     |          Python scalar
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      When the data type of `a` is longdouble or clongdouble, item() returns
     |      a scalar array object because there is no available Python scalar that
     |      would not lose information. Void arrays return a buffer object for item(),
     |      unless fields are defined, in which case a tuple is returned.
     |
     |      `item` is very similar to a[args], except, instead of an array scalar,
     |      a standard Python scalar is returned. This can be useful for speeding up
     |      access to elements of the array and doing arithmetic on elements of the
     |      array using Python's optimized math.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      >>> np.random.seed(123)
     |      >>> x = np.random.randint(9, size=(3, 3))
     |      >>> x
     |      array([[2, 2, 6],
     |             [1, 3, 6],
     |             [1, 0, 1]])

     |  itemset(...)
     |      a.itemset(*args)
     |
     |      Insert scalar into an array (scalar is cast to array's dtype, if possible)
     |
     |      There must be at least 1 argument, and define the last argument
     |      as *item*.  Then, ``a.itemset(*args)`` is equivalent to but faster
     |      than ``a[args] = item``.  The item should be a scalar value and `args`
     |      must select a single item in the array `a`.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      \*args : Arguments
     |          If one argument: a scalar, only used in case `a` is of size 1.
     |          If two arguments: the last argument is the value to be set
     |          and must be a scalar, the first argument specifies a single array
     |          element location. It is either an int or a tuple.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      Compared to indexing syntax, `itemset` provides some speed increase
     |      for placing a scalar into a particular location in an `ndarray`,
     |      if you must do this.  However, generally this is discouraged:
     |      among other problems, it complicates the appearance of the code.
     |      Also, when using `itemset` (and `item`) inside a loop, be sure
     |      to assign the methods to a local variable to avoid the attribute
     |      look-up at each loop iteration.
     |
     |      Examples

     |      >>> np.random.seed(123)
     |      >>> x = np.random.randint(9, size=(3, 3))
     |      >>> x
     |      array([[2, 2, 6],
     |             [1, 3, 6],

     |      >>> x.itemset(4, 0)
     |      >>> x.itemset((2, 2), 9)
     |      >>> x
     |      array([[2, 2, 6],

     |  newbyteorder(...)
     |      arr.newbyteorder(new_order='S', /)
     |
     |      Return the array with the same data viewed with a different byte order.
     |
     |      Equivalent to::
     |
     |          arr.view(arr.dtype.newbytorder(new_order))
     |
     |      Changes are also made in all fields and sub-arrays of the array data
     |      type.
     |
     |
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      new_order : string, optional
     |          Byte order to force; a value from the byte order specifications
     |          below. `new_order` codes can be any of:
     |
     |          * 'S' - swap dtype from current to opposite endian
     |          * {'<', 'little'} - little endian
     |          * {'>', 'big'} - big endian
     |          * {'=', 'native'} - native order, equivalent to `sys.byteorder`
     |          * {'|', 'I'} - ignore (no change to byte order)
     |
     |          The default value ('S') results in swapping the current
     |          byte order.
     |
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      new_arr : array
     |          New array object with the dtype reflecting given change to the
     |          byte order.
     |
     |  nonzero(...)

     |  partition(...)
     |      a.partition(kth, axis=-1, kind='introselect', order=None)
     |
     |      Rearranges the elements in the array in such a way that the value of the
     |      element in kth position is in the position it would be in a sorted array.
     |      All elements smaller than the kth element are moved before this element and
     |      all equal or greater are moved behind it. The ordering of the elements in
     |      the two partitions is undefined.
     |
     |      .. versionadded:: 1.8.0
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      kth : int or sequence of ints
     |          Element index to partition by. The kth element value will be in its
     |          final sorted position and all smaller elements will be moved before it
     |          and all equal or greater elements behind it.
     |          The order of all elements in the partitions is undefined.
     |          If provided with a sequence of kth it will partition all elements
     |          indexed by kth of them into their sorted position at once.
     |
     |          .. deprecated:: 1.22.0
     |              Passing booleans as index is deprecated.
     |      axis : int, optional
     |          Axis along which to sort. Default is -1, which means sort along the
     |          last axis.
     |      kind : {'introselect'}, optional
     |          Selection algorithm. Default is 'introselect'.
     |      order : str or list of str, optional
     |          When `a` is an array with fields defined, this argument specifies
     |          which fields to compare first, second, etc. A single field can
     |          be specified as a string, and not all fields need to be specified,
     |          but unspecified fields will still be used, in the order in which
     |          they come up in the dtype, to break ties.

     |
     |      See Also
     |      --------
     |      numpy.reshape : equivalent function
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      Unlike the free function `numpy.reshape`, this method on `ndarray` allows
     |      the elements of the shape parameter to be passed in as separate arguments.
     |      For example, ``a.reshape(10, 11)`` is equivalent to
     |      ``a.reshape((10, 11))``.
     |
     |  resize(...)
     |      a.resize(new_shape, refcheck=True)
     |
     |      Change shape and size of array in-place.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      new_shape : tuple of ints, or `n` ints
     |          Shape of resized array.
     |      refcheck : bool, optional
     |          If False, reference count will not be checked. Default is True.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      None
     |
     |      Raises
     |      ------
     |      ValueError
     |          If `a` does not own its own data or references or views to it exist,
     |          and the data memory must be changed.
     |          PyPy only: will always raise if the data memory must be changed, since
     |          there is no reliable way to determine if references or views to it
     |          exist.
     |
     |      SystemError
     |          If the `order` keyword argument is specified. This behaviour is a
     |          bug in NumPy.

     |      --------
     |      resize : Return a new array with the specified shape.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      This reallocates space for the data area if necessary.
     |
     |      Only contiguous arrays (data elements consecutive in memory) can be
     |      resized.
     |
     |      The purpose of the reference count check is to make sure you
     |      do not use this array as a buffer for another Python object and then
     |      reallocate the memory. However, reference counts can increase in
     |      other ways so if you are sure that you have not shared the memory
     |      for this array with another Python object, then you may safely set
     |      `refcheck` to False.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      Shrinking an array: array is flattened (in the order that the data are
     |      stored in memory), resized, and reshaped:
     |
     |      >>> a = np.array([[0, 1], [2, 3]], order='C')
     |      >>> a.resize((2, 1))
     |      >>> a
     |      array([[0],
     |             [1]])
     |
     |      >>> a = np.array([[0, 1], [2, 3]], order='F')
     |      >>> a.resize((2, 1))
     |      >>> a
     |      array([[0],
     |             [2]])
     |
     |      Enlarging an array: as above, but missing entries are filled with zeros:
     |
     |      >>> b = np.array([[0, 1], [2, 3]])
     |      >>> b.resize(2, 3) # new_shape parameter doesn't have to be a tuple
     |      >>> b
     |      array([[0, 1, 2],
     |             [3, 0, 0]])
     |
     |      Referencing an array prevents resizing...
     |
     |      >>> c = a
     |      >>> a.resize((1, 1))
     |      Traceback (most recent call last):
     |      ...
     |      ValueError: cannot resize an array that references or is referenced ...
     |
     |      Unless `refcheck` is False:
     |
     |      >>> a.resize((1, 1), refcheck=False)
     |      >>> a
     |      array([[0]])
     |      >>> c
     |      array([[0]])
     |
     |  round(...)
     |      a.round(decimals=0, out=None)
     |
     |      Return `a` with each element rounded to the given number of decimals.

     |      Put a value into a specified place in a field defined by a data-type.
     |
     |      Place `val` into `a`'s field defined by `dtype` and beginning `offset`
     |      bytes into the field.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      val : object
     |          Value to be placed in field.
     |      dtype : dtype object
     |          Data-type of the field in which to place `val`.
     |      offset : int, optional
     |          The number of bytes into the field at which to place `val`.

     |      >>> x.getfield(np.float64)
     |      array([[1.,  0.,  0.],
     |             [0.,  1.,  0.],

     |
     |  setflags(...)
     |      a.setflags(write=None, align=None, uic=None)
     |
     |      Set array flags WRITEABLE, ALIGNED, WRITEBACKIFCOPY,
     |      respectively.
     |
     |      These Boolean-valued flags affect how numpy interprets the memory
     |      area used by `a` (see Notes below). The ALIGNED flag can only
     |      be set to True if the data is actually aligned according to the type.
     |      The WRITEBACKIFCOPY and flag can never be set
     |      to True. The flag WRITEABLE can only be set to True if the array owns its
     |      own memory, or the ultimate owner of the memory exposes a writeable buffer
     |      interface, or is a string. (The exception for string is made so that
     |      unpickling can be done without copying memory.)
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      write : bool, optional
     |          Describes whether or not `a` can be written to.
     |      align : bool, optional
     |          Describes whether or not `a` is aligned properly for its type.
     |      uic : bool, optional
     |          Describes whether or not `a` is a copy of another "base" array.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      Array flags provide information about how the memory area used
     |      for the array is to be interpreted. There are 7 Boolean flags
     |      in use, only four of which can be changed by the user:
     |      WRITEBACKIFCOPY, WRITEABLE, and ALIGNED.
     |
     |      WRITEABLE (W) the data area can be written to;
     |
     |      ALIGNED (A) the data and strides are aligned appropriately for the hardware
     |      (as determined by the compiler);

     |      WRITEBACKIFCOPY (X) this array is a copy of some other array (referenced
     |      by .base). When the C-API function PyArray_ResolveWritebackIfCopy is
     |      called, the base array will be updated with the contents of this array.
     |
     |      All flags can be accessed using the single (upper case) letter as well
     |      as the full name.

     |
     |  sort(...)
     |      a.sort(axis=-1, kind=None, order=None)
     |
     |      Sort an array in-place. Refer to `numpy.sort` for full documentation.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      axis : int, optional
     |          Axis along which to sort. Default is -1, which means sort along the
     |          last axis.
     |      kind : {'quicksort', 'mergesort', 'heapsort', 'stable'}, optional
     |          Sorting algorithm. The default is 'quicksort'. Note that both 'stable'
     |          and 'mergesort' use timsort under the covers and, in general, the
     |          actual implementation will vary with datatype. The 'mergesort' option
     |          is retained for backwards compatibility.
     |
     |          .. versionchanged:: 1.15.0
     |             The 'stable' option was added.
     |
     |      order : str or list of str, optional
     |          When `a` is an array with fields defined, this argument specifies
     |          which fields to compare first, second, etc.  A single field can
     |          be specified as a string, and not all fields need be specified,
     |          but unspecified fields will still be used, in the order in which
     |          they come up in the dtype, to break ties.

     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      >>> a = np.array([[1,4], [3,1]])
     |      >>> a.sort(axis=1)

     |      Use the `order` keyword to specify a field to use when sorting a
     |      structured array:
     |
     |      >>> a = np.array([('a', 2), ('c', 1)], dtype=[('x', 'S1'), ('y', int)])
     |      >>> a.sort(order='y')
     |      >>> a
     |      array([(b'c', 1), (b'a', 2)],
     |            dtype=[('x', 'S1'), ('y', '<i8')])
     |

     |  tobytes(...)
     |      a.tobytes(order='C')
     |
     |      Construct Python bytes containing the raw data bytes in the array.
     |
     |      Constructs Python bytes showing a copy of the raw contents of
     |      data memory. The bytes object is produced in C-order by default.
     |      This behavior is controlled by the ``order`` parameter.
     |
     |      .. versionadded:: 1.9.0
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      order : {'C', 'F', 'A'}, optional
     |          Controls the memory layout of the bytes object. 'C' means C-order,
     |          'F' means F-order, 'A' (short for *Any*) means 'F' if `a` is
     |          Fortran contiguous, 'C' otherwise. Default is 'C'.
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      s : bytes
     |          Python bytes exhibiting a copy of `a`'s raw data.

     |      --------
     |      frombuffer
     |          Inverse of this operation, construct a 1-dimensional array from Python
     |          bytes.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      >>> x = np.array([[0, 1], [2, 3]], dtype='<u2')
     |      >>> x.tobytes()
     |      b'\x00\x00\x01\x00\x02\x00\x03\x00'
     |      >>> x.tobytes('C') == x.tobytes()
     |      True
     |      >>> x.tobytes('F')
     |      b'\x00\x00\x02\x00\x01\x00\x03\x00'
     |
     |  tofile(...)
     |      a.tofile(fid, sep="", format="%s")
     |
     |      Write array to a file as text or binary (default).
     |
     |      Data is always written in 'C' order, independent of the order of `a`.
     |      The data produced by this method can be recovered using the function
     |      fromfile().
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      fid : file or str or Path
     |          An open file object, or a string containing a filename.
     |
     |          .. versionchanged:: 1.17.0
     |              `pathlib.Path` objects are now accepted.
     |
     |      sep : str
     |          Separator between array items for text output.
     |          If "" (empty), a binary file is written, equivalent to
     |          ``file.write(a.tobytes())``.
     |      format : str
     |          Format string for text file output.
     |          Each entry in the array is formatted to text by first converting
     |          it to the closest Python type, and then using "format" % item.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      This is a convenience function for quick storage of array data.
     |      Information on endianness and precision is lost, so this method is not a
     |      good choice for files intended to archive data or transport data between
     |      machines with different endianness. Some of these problems can be overcome
     |      by outputting the data as text files, at the expense of speed and file
     |      size.
     |
     |      When fid is a file object, array contents are directly written to the
     |      file, bypassing the file object's ``write`` method. As a result, tofile
     |      cannot be used with files objects supporting compression (e.g., GzipFile)
     |      or file-like objects that do not support ``fileno()`` (e.g., BytesIO).
     |
     |  tolist(...)
     |      a.tolist()
     |
     |      Return the array as an ``a.ndim``-levels deep nested list of Python scalars.
     |
     |      Return a copy of the array data as a (nested) Python list.
     |      Data items are converted to the nearest compatible builtin Python type, via
     |      the `~numpy.ndarray.item` function.
     |
     |      If ``a.ndim`` is 0, then since the depth of the nested list is 0, it will
     |      not be a list at all, but a simple Python scalar.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      none
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      y : object, or list of object, or list of list of object, or ...
     |          The possibly nested list of array elements.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The array may be recreated via ``a = np.array(a.tolist())``, although this
     |      may sometimes lose precision.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      For a 1D array, ``a.tolist()`` is almost the same as ``list(a)``,
     |      except that ``tolist`` changes numpy scalars to Python scalars:
     |
     |      >>> a = np.uint32([1, 2])
     |      >>> a_list = list(a)
     |      >>> a_list
     |      [1, 2]
     |      >>> type(a_list[0])
     |      <class 'numpy.uint32'>
     |      >>> a_tolist = a.tolist()
     |      >>> a_tolist
     |      [1, 2]
     |      >>> type(a_tolist[0])
     |      <class 'int'>
     |
     |      Additionally, for a 2D array, ``tolist`` applies recursively:
     |
     |      >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
     |      >>> list(a)
     |      [array([1, 2]), array([3, 4])]
     |      >>> a.tolist()
     |      [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
     |
     |      The base case for this recursion is a 0D array:
     |
     |      >>> a = np.array(1)
     |      >>> list(a)
     |      Traceback (most recent call last):
     |        ...
     |      TypeError: iteration over a 0-d array
     |      >>> a.tolist()
     |      1
     |
     |  tostring(...)
     |      a.tostring(order='C')
     |
     |      A compatibility alias for `tobytes`, with exactly the same behavior.
     |
     |      Despite its name, it returns `bytes` not `str`\ s.
     |
     |      .. deprecated:: 1.19.0
     |
     |  trace(...)
     |      a.trace(offset=0, axis1=0, axis2=1, dtype=None, out=None)
     |
     |      Return the sum along diagonals of the array.
     |
     |      Refer to `numpy.trace` for full documentation.
     |
     |      See Also
     |      --------

     |  transpose(...)
     |      a.transpose(*axes)
     |
     |      Returns a view of the array with axes transposed.
     |
     |      Refer to `numpy.transpose` for full documentation.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      axes : None, tuple of ints, or `n` ints
     |
     |       * None or no argument: reverses the order of the axes.
     |
     |       * tuple of ints: `i` in the `j`-th place in the tuple means that the
     |         array's `i`-th axis becomes the transposed array's `j`-th axis.
     |
     |       * `n` ints: same as an n-tuple of the same ints (this form is
     |         intended simply as a "convenience" alternative to the tuple form).
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      p : ndarray
     |          View of the array with its axes suitably permuted.

     |      ndarray.reshape : Give a new shape to an array without changing its data.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
     |      >>> a
     |      array([[1, 2],
     |             [3, 4]])
     |      >>> a.transpose()
     |      array([[1, 3],
     |             [2, 4]])
     |      >>> a.transpose((1, 0))
     |      array([[1, 3],
     |             [2, 4]])
     |      >>> a.transpose(1, 0)
     |      array([[1, 3],
     |             [2, 4]])

     |
     |  var(...)
     |      a.var(axis=None, dtype=None, out=None, ddof=0, keepdims=False, *, where=True)
     |
     |      Returns the variance of the array elements, along given axis.

     |  view(...)
     |      a.view([dtype][, type])
     |
     |      New view of array with the same data.
     |
     |      .. note::
     |          Passing None for ``dtype`` is different from omitting the parameter,
     |          since the former invokes ``dtype(None)`` which is an alias for
     |          ``dtype('float_')``.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      dtype : data-type or ndarray sub-class, optional
     |          Data-type descriptor of the returned view, e.g., float32 or int16.
     |          Omitting it results in the view having the same data-type as `a`.
     |          This argument can also be specified as an ndarray sub-class, which
     |          then specifies the type of the returned object (this is equivalent to
     |          setting the ``type`` parameter).
     |      type : Python type, optional
     |          Type of the returned view, e.g., ndarray or matrix.  Again, omission
     |          of the parameter results in type preservation.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      ``a.view()`` is used two different ways:
     |
     |      ``a.view(some_dtype)`` or ``a.view(dtype=some_dtype)`` constructs a view
     |      of the array's memory with a different data-type.  This can cause a
     |      reinterpretation of the bytes of memory.
     |
     |      ``a.view(ndarray_subclass)`` or ``a.view(type=ndarray_subclass)`` just
     |      returns an instance of `ndarray_subclass` that looks at the same array
     |      (same shape, dtype, etc.)  This does not cause a reinterpretation of the
     |      memory.
     |
     |      For ``a.view(some_dtype)``, if ``some_dtype`` has a different number of
     |      bytes per entry than the previous dtype (for example, converting a regular
     |      array to a structured array), then the last axis of ``a`` must be
     |      contiguous. This axis will be resized in the result.
     |
     |      .. versionchanged:: 1.23.0
     |         Only the last axis needs to be contiguous. Previously, the entire array
     |         had to be C-contiguous.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      >>> x = np.array([(1, 2)], dtype=[('a', np.int8), ('b', np.int8)])
     |
     |      Viewing array data using a different type and dtype:
     |
     |      >>> y = x.view(dtype=np.int16, type=np.matrix)
     |      >>> y
     |      matrix([[513]], dtype=int16)
     |      >>> print(type(y))
     |      <class 'numpy.matrix'>
     |
     |      Creating a view on a structured array so it can be used in calculations
     |
     |      >>> x = np.array([(1, 2),(3,4)], dtype=[('a', np.int8), ('b', np.int8)])
     |      >>> xv = x.view(dtype=np.int8).reshape(-1,2)
     |      >>> xv
     |      array([[1, 2],
     |             [3, 4]], dtype=int8)
     |      >>> xv.mean(0)
     |      array([2.,  3.])
     |
     |      Making changes to the view changes the underlying array
     |
     |      >>> xv[0,1] = 20
     |      >>> x
     |      array([(1, 20), (3,  4)], dtype=[('a', 'i1'), ('b', 'i1')])
     |
     |      Using a view to convert an array to a recarray:
     |
     |      >>> z = x.view(np.recarray)
     |      >>> z.a
     |      array([1, 3], dtype=int8)
     |
     |      Views share data:
     |
     |      >>> x[0] = (9, 10)
     |      >>> z[0]
     |      (9, 10)
     |
     |      Views that change the dtype size (bytes per entry) should normally be
     |      avoided on arrays defined by slices, transposes, fortran-ordering, etc.:
     |
     |      >>> x = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], dtype=np.int16)
     |      >>> y = x[:, ::2]
     |      >>> y
     |      array([[1, 3],
     |             [4, 6]], dtype=int16)
     |      >>> y.view(dtype=[('width', np.int16), ('length', np.int16)])
     |      Traceback (most recent call last):
     |          ...
     |      ValueError: To change to a dtype of a different size, the last axis must be contiguous
     |      >>> z = y.copy()
     |      >>> z.view(dtype=[('width', np.int16), ('length', np.int16)])
     |      array([[(1, 3)],
     |             [(4, 6)]], dtype=[('width', '<i2'), ('length', '<i2')])
     |
     |      However, views that change dtype are totally fine for arrays with a
     |      contiguous last axis, even if the rest of the axes are not C-contiguous:
     |
     |      >>> x = np.arange(2 * 3 * 4, dtype=np.int8).reshape(2, 3, 4)
     |      >>> x.transpose(1, 0, 2).view(np.int16)
     |      array([[[ 256,  770],
     |              [3340, 3854]],
     |      <BLANKLINE>
     |             [[1284, 1798],
     |              [4368, 4882]],
     |      <BLANKLINE>
     |             [[2312, 2826],

     |
     |  ctypes
     |      An object to simplify the interaction of the array with the ctypes
     |      module.
     |
     |      This attribute creates an object that makes it easier to use arrays
     |      when calling shared libraries with the ctypes module. The returned
     |      object has, among others, data, shape, and strides attributes (see
     |      Notes below) which themselves return ctypes objects that can be used
     |      as arguments to a shared library.
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      None
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      c : Python object
     |          Possessing attributes data, shape, strides, etc.

     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      Below are the public attributes of this object which were documented
     |      in "Guide to NumPy" (we have omitted undocumented public attributes,
     |      as well as documented private attributes):
     |
     |      .. autoattribute:: numpy.core._internal._ctypes.data
     |          :noindex:
     |
     |      .. autoattribute:: numpy.core._internal._ctypes.shape

     |
     |      If the ctypes module is not available, then the ctypes attribute
     |      of array objects still returns something useful, but ctypes objects
     |      are not returned and errors may be raised instead. In particular,
     |      the object will still have the ``as_parameter`` attribute which will
     |      return an integer equal to the data attribute.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      >>> import ctypes
     |      >>> x = np.array([[0, 1], [2, 3]], dtype=np.int32)
     |      >>> x
     |      array([[0, 1],

     |  data
     |      Python buffer object pointing to the start of the array's data.

     |
     |      .. warning::
     |
     |          Setting ``arr.dtype`` is discouraged and may be deprecated in the
     |          future.  Setting will replace the ``dtype`` without modifying the
     |          memory (see also `ndarray.view` and `ndarray.astype`).
     |
     |      Parameters
     |      ----------
     |      None
     |
     |      Returns
     |      -------
     |      d : numpy dtype object
     |
     |      See Also
     |      --------
     |      ndarray.astype : Cast the values contained in the array to a new data-type.
     |      ndarray.view : Create a view of the same data but a different data-type.
     |      numpy.dtype
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      >>> x
     |      array([[0, 1],
     |             [2, 3]])
     |      >>> x.dtype
     |      dtype('int32')
     |      >>> type(x.dtype)
     |      <type 'numpy.dtype'>
     |
     |  flags
     |      Information about the memory layout of the array.
     |
     |      Attributes
     |      ----------
     |      C_CONTIGUOUS (C)
     |          The data is in a single, C-style contiguous segment.
     |      F_CONTIGUOUS (F)
     |          The data is in a single, Fortran-style contiguous segment.
     |      OWNDATA (O)
     |          The array owns the memory it uses or borrows it from another object.
     |      WRITEABLE (W)
     |          The data area can be written to.  Setting this to False locks
     |          the data, making it read-only.  A view (slice, etc.) inherits WRITEABLE
     |          from its base array at creation time, but a view of a writeable
     |          array may be subsequently locked while the base array remains writeable.
     |          (The opposite is not true, in that a view of a locked array may not
     |          be made writeable.  However, currently, locking a base object does not
     |          lock any views that already reference it, so under that circumstance it
     |          is possible to alter the contents of a locked array via a previously
     |          created writeable view onto it.)  Attempting to change a non-writeable
     |          array raises a RuntimeError exception.
     |      ALIGNED (A)
     |          The data and all elements are aligned appropriately for the hardware.
     |      WRITEBACKIFCOPY (X)
     |          This array is a copy of some other array. The C-API function
     |          PyArray_ResolveWritebackIfCopy must be called before deallocating
     |          to the base array will be updated with the contents of this array.
     |      FNC
     |          F_CONTIGUOUS and not C_CONTIGUOUS.
     |      FORC
     |          F_CONTIGUOUS or C_CONTIGUOUS (one-segment test).
     |      BEHAVED (B)
     |          ALIGNED and WRITEABLE.
     |      CARRAY (CA)
     |          BEHAVED and C_CONTIGUOUS.
     |      FARRAY (FA)
     |          BEHAVED and F_CONTIGUOUS and not C_CONTIGUOUS.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      The `flags` object can be accessed dictionary-like (as in ``a.flags['WRITEABLE']``),
     |      or by using lowercased attribute names (as in ``a.flags.writeable``). Short flag
     |      names are only supported in dictionary access.
     |
     |      Only the WRITEBACKIFCOPY, WRITEABLE, and ALIGNED flags can be
     |      changed by the user, via direct assignment to the attribute or dictionary
     |      entry, or by calling `ndarray.setflags`.
     |
     |      The array flags cannot be set arbitrarily:
     |
     |      - WRITEBACKIFCOPY can only be set ``False``.
     |      - ALIGNED can only be set ``True`` if the data is truly aligned.
     |      - WRITEABLE can only be set ``True`` if the array owns its own memory
     |        or the ultimate owner of the memory exposes a writeable buffer
     |        interface or is a string.
     |
     |      Arrays can be both C-style and Fortran-style contiguous simultaneously.
     |      This is clear for 1-dimensional arrays, but can also be true for higher
     |      dimensional arrays.
     |
     |      Even for contiguous arrays a stride for a given dimension
     |      ``arr.strides[dim]`` may be *arbitrary* if ``arr.shape[dim] == 1``
     |      or the array has no elements.
     |      It does *not* generally hold that ``self.strides[-1] == self.itemsize``
     |      for C-style contiguous arrays or ``self.strides[0] == self.itemsize`` for
     |      Fortran-style contiguous arrays is true.
     |
     |  flat
     |      A 1-D iterator over the array.
     |
     |      This is a `numpy.flatiter` instance, which acts similarly to, but is not
     |      a subclass of, Python's built-in iterator object.
     |
     |      See Also
     |      --------
     |      flatten : Return a copy of the array collapsed into one dimension.

     |      >>> x = np.arange(1, 7).reshape(2, 3)
     |      >>> x
     |      array([[1, 2, 3],
     |             [4, 5, 6]])
     |      >>> x.flat[3]

     |      >>> type(x.flat)
     |      <class 'numpy.flatiter'>
     |
     |      An assignment example:

     |      >>> x.flat = 3; x
     |      array([[3, 3, 3],
     |             [3, 3, 3]])
     |      >>> x.flat[[1,4]] = 1; x
     |      array([[3, 1, 3],
     |             [3, 1, 3]])
     |
     |  imag
     |      The imaginary part of the array.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      >>> x = np.sqrt([1+0j, 0+1j])
     |      >>> x.imag
     |      array([ 0.        ,  0.70710678])
     |      >>> x.imag.dtype
     |      dtype('float64')
     |
     |  itemsize
     |      Length of one array element in bytes.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      >>> x = np.array([1,2,3], dtype=np.float64)
     |      >>> x.itemsize
     |      8
     |      >>> x = np.array([1,2,3], dtype=np.complex128)
     |      >>> x.itemsize
     |      16
     |
     |  nbytes
     |      Total bytes consumed by the elements of the array.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      Does not include memory consumed by non-element attributes of the
     |      array object.
     |
     |      See Also
     |      --------
     |      sys.getsizeof
     |          Memory consumed by the object itself without parents in case view.
     |          This does include memory consumed by non-element attributes.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      >>> x = np.zeros((3,5,2), dtype=np.complex128)
     |      >>> x.nbytes
     |      480
     |      >>> np.prod(x.shape) * x.itemsize
     |      480
     |
     |  ndim
     |      Number of array dimensions.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
     |      >>> x.ndim
     |      1
     |      >>> y = np.zeros((2, 3, 4))
     |      >>> y.ndim
     |      3
     |
     |  real
     |      The real part of the array.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      >>> x = np.sqrt([1+0j, 0+1j])
     |      >>> x.real
     |      array([ 1.        ,  0.70710678])
     |      >>> x.real.dtype

     |      --------
     |      numpy.real : equivalent function
     |
     |  shape
     |      Tuple of array dimensions.
     |
     |      The shape property is usually used to get the current shape of an array,
     |      but may also be used to reshape the array in-place by assigning a tuple of
     |      array dimensions to it.  As with `numpy.reshape`, one of the new shape
     |      dimensions can be -1, in which case its value is inferred from the size of
     |      the array and the remaining dimensions. Reshaping an array in-place will
     |      fail if a copy is required.
     |
     |      .. warning::
     |
     |          Setting ``arr.shape`` is discouraged and may be deprecated in the
     |          future.  Using `ndarray.reshape` is the preferred approach.

     |
     |  size
     |      Number of elements in the array.
     |
     |      Equal to ``np.prod(a.shape)``, i.e., the product of the array's
     |      dimensions.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      `a.size` returns a standard arbitrary precision Python integer. This
     |      may not be the case with other methods of obtaining the same value
     |      (like the suggested ``np.prod(a.shape)``, which returns an instance
     |      of ``np.int_``), and may be relevant if the value is used further in
     |      calculations that may overflow a fixed size integer type.
     |
     |      Examples
     |      --------
     |      >>> x = np.zeros((3, 5, 2), dtype=np.complex128)
     |      >>> x.size
     |      30
     |      >>> np.prod(x.shape)
     |      30
     |
     |  strides
     |      Tuple of bytes to step in each dimension when traversing an array.
     |
     |      The byte offset of element ``(i[0], i[1], ..., i[n])`` in an array `a`
     |      is::
     |
     |          offset = sum(np.array(i) * a.strides)
     |
     |      A more detailed explanation of strides can be found in the
     |      "ndarray.rst" file in the NumPy reference guide.
     |
     |      .. warning::
     |
     |          Setting ``arr.strides`` is discouraged and may be deprecated in the
     |          future.  `numpy.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided` should be preferred
     |          to create a new view of the same data in a safer way.
     |
     |      Notes
     |      -----
     |      Imagine an array of 32-bit integers (each 4 bytes)::
     |
     |        x = np.array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
     |                      [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]], dtype=np.int32)
     |
     |      This array is stored in memory as 40 bytes, one after the other
     |      (known as a contiguous block of memory).  The strides of an array tell
     |      us how many bytes we have to skip in memory to move to the next position
     |      along a certain axis.  For example, we have to skip 4 bytes (1 value) to
     |      move to the next column, but 20 bytes (5 values) to get to the same
     |      position in the next row.  As such, the strides for the array `x` will be
     |      ``(20, 4)``.

FUNCTIONS
    array(obj, dtype=None, shape=None, offset=0, strides=None, formats=None, names=None, titles=None, aligned=False, byteorder=None, copy=True)
        Construct a record array from a wide-variety of objects.

        A general-purpose record array constructor that dispatches to the
        appropriate `recarray` creation function based on the inputs (see Notes).

        Parameters
        ----------
        obj : any
            Input object. See Notes for details on how various input types are
            treated.
        dtype : data-type, optional
            Valid dtype for array.
        shape : int or tuple of ints, optional
            Shape of each array.
        offset : int, optional
            Position in the file or buffer to start reading from.
        strides : tuple of ints, optional
            Buffer (`buf`) is interpreted according to these strides (strides
            define how many bytes each array element, row, column, etc.
            occupy in memory).
        formats, names, titles, aligned, byteorder :
            If `dtype` is ``None``, these arguments are passed to
            `numpy.format_parser` to construct a dtype. See that function for
            detailed documentation.
        copy : bool, optional
            Whether to copy the input object (True), or to use a reference instead.
            This option only applies when the input is an ndarray or recarray.
            Defaults to True.

        Returns
        -------
        np.recarray
            Record array created from the specified object.

        Notes
        -----
        If `obj` is ``None``, then call the `~numpy.recarray` constructor. If
        `obj` is a string, then call the `fromstring` constructor. If `obj` is a
        list or a tuple, then if the first object is an `~numpy.ndarray`, call
        `fromarrays`, otherwise call `fromrecords`. If `obj` is a
        `~numpy.recarray`, then make a copy of the data in the recarray
        (if ``copy=True``) and use the new formats, names, and titles. If `obj`
        is a file, then call `fromfile`. Finally, if obj is an `ndarray`, then
        return ``obj.view(recarray)``, making a copy of the data if ``copy=True``.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
        array([[1, 2, 3],
               [4, 5, 6],

        >>> np.core.records.array(a)
        rec.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6],
                   [7, 8, 9]],
            dtype=int32)

        >>> b = [(1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9)]

        >>> c.x
        rec.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=int16)

        >>> c.y
        rec.array([ 1.0,  4.0,  9.0], dtype=float16)

        >>> r = np.rec.array(['abc','def'], names=['col1','col2'])
        >>> print(r.col1)
        abc

        >>> r.col1
        array('abc', dtype='<U3')

        >>> r.col2
        array('def', dtype='<U3')

    fromarrays(arrayList, dtype=None, shape=None, formats=None, names=None, titles=None, aligned=False, byteorder=None)
        Create a record array from a (flat) list of arrays

        Parameters
        ----------
        arrayList : list or tuple
            List of array-like objects (such as lists, tuples,
            and ndarrays).

            Shape of the resulting array. If not provided, inferred from
            ``arrayList[0]``.
        formats, names, titles, aligned, byteorder :
            If `dtype` is ``None``, these arguments are passed to
            `numpy.format_parser` to construct a dtype. See that function for
            detailed documentation.

        Create an array from binary file data

        Parameters
        ----------
        fd : str or file type
            If file is a string or a path-like object then that file is opened,
            else it is assumed to be a file object. The file object must
            support random access (i.e. it must have tell and seek methods).
        dtype : data-type, optional
            valid dtype for all arrays
        shape : int or tuple of ints, optional
            shape of each array.
        offset : int, optional
            Position in the file to start reading from.
        formats, names, titles, aligned, byteorder :
            If `dtype` is ``None``, these arguments are passed to
            `numpy.format_parser` to construct a dtype. See that function for
            detailed documentation

        Returns
        -------
        np.recarray
            record array consisting of data enclosed in file.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> from tempfile import TemporaryFile
        >>> a = np.empty(10,dtype='f8,i4,a5')
        >>> a[5] = (0.5,10,'abcde')
        >>>
        >>> fd=TemporaryFile()
        >>> a = a.newbyteorder('<')
        >>> a.tofile(fd)
        >>>
        >>> _ = fd.seek(0)
        >>> r=np.core.records.fromfile(fd, formats='f8,i4,a5', shape=10,
        ... byteorder='<')
        >>> print(r[5])
        (0.5, 10, 'abcde')
        >>> r.shape
        (10,)

    fromrecords(recList, dtype=None, shape=None, formats=None, names=None, titles=None, aligned=False, byteorder=None)
        Create a recarray from a list of records in text form.

        Parameters
        ----------
        recList : sequence
            data in the same field may be heterogeneous - they will be promoted
            to the highest data type.
        dtype : data-type, optional
            valid dtype for all arrays
        shape : int or tuple of ints, optional
            shape of each array.
        formats, names, titles, aligned, byteorder :
            If `dtype` is ``None``, these arguments are passed to
            `numpy.format_parser` to construct a dtype. See that function for
            detailed documentation.

            If both `formats` and `dtype` are None, then this will auto-detect
            formats. Use list of tuples rather than list of lists for faster
            processing.

        Returns
        -------
        np.recarray
            record array consisting of given recList rows.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> r=np.core.records.fromrecords([(456,'dbe',1.2),(2,'de',1.3)],
        ... names='col1,col2,col3')

        array([456,   2])
        >>> r.col2
        array(['dbe', 'de'], dtype='<U3')
        >>> import pickle
        >>> pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(r))
        rec.array([(456, 'dbe', 1.2), (  2, 'de', 1.3)],
                  dtype=[('col1', '<i8'), ('col2', '<U3'), ('col3', '<f8')])

    fromstring(datastring, dtype=None, shape=None, offset=0, formats=None, names=None, titles=None, aligned=False, byteorder=None)
        Create a record array from binary data

        Note that despite the name of this function it does not accept `str`
        instances.

        Parameters
        ----------
        datastring : bytes-like
            Buffer of binary data
        dtype : data-type, optional
            Valid dtype for all arrays

            Shape of each array.
        offset : int, optional
            Position in the buffer to start reading from.
        formats, names, titles, aligned, byteorder :
            If `dtype` is ``None``, these arguments are passed to
            `numpy.format_parser` to construct a dtype. See that function for
            detailed documentation.


        Returns
        -------
        np.recarray
            Record array view into the data in datastring. This will be readonly
            if `datastring` is readonly.

repeat(a, repeats, axis=None)
    Repeat each element of an array after themselves

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    repeats : int or array of ints
        The number of repetitions for each element.  `repeats` is broadcasted
        to fit the shape of the given axis.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which to repeat values.  By default, use the
        flattened input array, and return a flat output array.

    Returns
    -------
    repeated_array : ndarray
        Output array which has the same shape as `a`, except along
        the given axis.

    See Also
    --------
    tile : Tile an array.
    unique : Find the unique elements of an array.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.repeat(3, 4)
    array([3, 3, 3, 3])
    >>> x = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
    >>> np.repeat(x, 2)
    array([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4])
    >>> np.repeat(x, 3, axis=1)
    array([[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2],
           [3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]])
    >>> np.repeat(x, [1, 2], axis=0)

reshape(a, newshape, order='C')
    Gives a new shape to an array without changing its data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array to be reshaped.
    newshape : int or tuple of ints
        The new shape should be compatible with the original shape. If
        an integer, then the result will be a 1-D array of that length.
        One shape dimension can be -1. In this case, the value is
        inferred from the length of the array and remaining dimensions.
    order : {'C', 'F', 'A'}, optional
        Read the elements of `a` using this index order, and place the
        elements into the reshaped array using this index order.  'C'
        means to read / write the elements using C-like index order,
        with the last axis index changing fastest, back to the first
        axis index changing slowest. 'F' means to read / write the
        elements using Fortran-like index order, with the first index
        changing fastest, and the last index changing slowest. Note that
        the 'C' and 'F' options take no account of the memory layout of
        the underlying array, and only refer to the order of indexing.
        'A' means to read / write the elements in Fortran-like index
        order if `a` is Fortran *contiguous* in memory, C-like order
        otherwise.

    Returns
    -------
    reshaped_array : ndarray
        This will be a new view object if possible; otherwise, it will
        be a copy.  Note there is no guarantee of the *memory layout* (C- or
        Fortran- contiguous) of the returned array.

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.reshape : Equivalent method.

    Notes
    -----
    It is not always possible to change the shape of an array without copying
    the data.

    The `order` keyword gives the index ordering both for *fetching* the values
    from `a`, and then *placing* the values into the output array.
    For example, let's say you have an array:

    >>> a = np.arange(6).reshape((3, 2))
    >>> a
    array([[0, 1],
           [2, 3],
           [4, 5]])

    You can think of reshaping as first raveling the array (using the given
    index order), then inserting the elements from the raveled array into the
    new array using the same kind of index ordering as was used for the
    raveling.

    >>> np.reshape(a, (2, 3)) # C-like index ordering
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5]])
    >>> np.reshape(np.ravel(a), (2, 3)) # equivalent to C ravel then C reshape
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5]])
    >>> np.reshape(a, (2, 3), order='F') # Fortran-like index ordering
    array([[0, 4, 3],
           [2, 1, 5]])
    >>> np.reshape(np.ravel(a, order='F'), (2, 3), order='F')
    array([[0, 4, 3],
           [2, 1, 5]])

    Examples
    --------
    >>> a = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]])
    >>> np.reshape(a, 6)
    array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
    >>> np.reshape(a, 6, order='F')
    array([1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6])

    >>> np.reshape(a, (3,-1))       # the unspecified value is inferred to be 2

Help on _ArrayFunctionDispatcher in module numpy:

roll(a, shift, axis=None)
    Roll array elements along a given axis.

    Elements that roll beyond the last position are re-introduced at
    the first.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    shift : int or tuple of ints
        The number of places by which elements are shifted.  If a tuple,
        then `axis` must be a tuple of the same size, and each of the
        given axes is shifted by the corresponding number.  If an int
        while `axis` is a tuple of ints, then the same value is used for
        all given axes.
    axis : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which elements are shifted.  By default, the
        array is flattened before shifting, after which the original
        shape is restored.

    Returns
    -------
    res : ndarray
        Output array, with the same shape as `a`.

    See Also
    --------
    rollaxis : Roll the specified axis backwards, until it lies in a
               given position.

    Notes
    -----
    .. versionadded:: 1.12.0

    Supports rolling over multiple dimensions simultaneously.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.arange(10)
    >>> np.roll(x, 2)
    array([8, 9, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
    >>> np.roll(x, -2)
    array([2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 1])

    >>> x2 = np.reshape(x, (2, 5))
    >>> x2
    array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
           [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]])
    >>> np.roll(x2, 1)
    array([[9, 0, 1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]])
    >>> np.roll(x2, -1)
    array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
           [6, 7, 8, 9, 0]])
    >>> np.roll(x2, 1, axis=0)
    array([[5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
           [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]])
    >>> np.roll(x2, -1, axis=0)
    array([[5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
           [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]])
    >>> np.roll(x2, 1, axis=1)
    array([[4, 0, 1, 2, 3],
           [9, 5, 6, 7, 8]])
    >>> np.roll(x2, -1, axis=1)
    array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 0],
           [6, 7, 8, 9, 5]])
    >>> np.roll(x2, (1, 1), axis=(1, 0))
    array([[9, 5, 6, 7, 8],
           [4, 0, 1, 2, 3]])
    >>> np.roll(x2, (2, 1), axis=(1, 0))
    array([[8, 9, 5, 6, 7],
           [3, 4, 0, 1, 2]])
